Dawn 9.0.0 introduces app blocks in header, video upload with auto-loop, "Click and hover" zoom, new desktop header menu style, a gift card recipient form, and some performance improvements on images.

### Added

- Important: Fade in animations will now be enabled by default on your theme. If you’d like to disable them, navigate to your theme settings → animations → uncheck “Reveal sections on scroll”.
- Important: We’ve introduced a new visual way of setting your theme's colors. In your theme settings, you can now configure 5+ color schemes and apply them across sections in your themes. The default colors are created based on your theme’s current color settings, but we recommend reviewing them before publishing.
- We’ve added new animations to your theme settings where you can have sections fade in or slide in when the user scrolls.
- You can pick a new hover effect for buttons and cards - 3D lift.
- You now have options to add animations on the Image with Text and Image Banner sections.
- We added options to change the shape of the product card images.
- We introduced the ability to send and schedule a gift card to a recipient.
- You can now create different color schemes and apply them across your pages and sections.

### Changed

- Important: Color schemes now apply to content on the Image Banner and Slideshow sections, regardless of container visibility. Please review and adjust color schemes to ensure the content is readable.
- There are now unique identifiers on navigation links, which lets you add custom CSS in the Header section.
- We improved the announcement bar by adding a slider for each announcement instead of stacking them on top of each other.
- We introduced new placeholder images across all theme sections.

### Fixes and improvements

- We improved the performance of the Multicolumn section by reducing the image sizes being loaded.
- We fixed the blog post slides to show a preview of the subsequent slide.
- We optimized the logo width to ensure the image looked crisp on all device sizes.
