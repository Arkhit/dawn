        <h2>Our process </h2>
        <p> Our process includes hand sanding the fiberglass surface to an ultra-smooth 
        finish before each canopy is coated in multiple layers of industrial UV-resistant resin, 
        which prevents long-term flaking and discolouration. Additional sealants are applied to 
        completely weatherproof the entire unit.</p>
