Grab your sports clothes, sneakers, and sweatpants, if that’s what you’re comfortable in. You do you. Get comfortable – the rest of the night will take care of itself.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>2. Casual <\/strong><\/p><p>If you’re heading somewhere with a casual dress code, pretty much anything goes (as long as you avoid the shorts and streetwear vibe). Wearing jeans and a T-shirt? You’re in. <\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>3. Club style <\/strong><\/p><p>Time to ditch the casual and bring out the big guns. Think trendy dresses, heels, halter tops, glitter and all the sparkle. Accessories are a must. It’s time to club it like you mean it.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>4. Smart casual<\/strong><\/p><p>The smart-casual vibe can be a fine balancing act, but will help you get into most nightclubs. It’s a look we can all relate to when we want to make minimal effort but still look like we're dressing to impress. <\/p><p>Try smart jeans, (the neat and clean kind, free of fading and holes). To accompany them, opt for items such as blouses, jackets and shirts for an effortlessly classy look.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>5. Semi-formal<\/strong><\/p><p>For these types of venues, think about what you’d usually wear for a business meeting or an informal wedding. (And bear in mind that anything denim is out of the question.)<\/p><p>Make sure that you stick to something not too revealing. Think classy over sexy. And as it’s a more formal occasion, ditch the flats – heels are a must.<br\/><\/p><p><strong>6. Formal\/black tie<\/strong><\/p><p>Your typical nightclub won’t have a formal or black tie dress code. These dress codes are usually reserved for wine bars or cocktail clubs. So when the occasion arises, get out a stunning cocktail dress and the perfect heels to match.<\/p>",
