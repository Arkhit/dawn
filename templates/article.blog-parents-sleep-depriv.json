But at 3am, when they’ve woken you up every hour, on the hour, their cuteness just doesn’t cut it. <\/p><p>And you can’t say we don’t get fair warning on the matter…<\/p><p>“You won’t be sleeping in once the baby arrives.” they said. “Rest while you can.”<\/p><p>[<strong>All said with a knowing smile<\/strong>].<\/p><p>Yep, thanks for that. Not. Helpful. <\/p><p>Because while it’s widely known that parenthood and peaceful sleep don’t go hand in hand, it doesn’t change the fact that all that lost sleep can be a huge shock to the system. <\/p><p>So how much sleep do new parents get? The answer: not a lot. In the very early days, babies have no sense of day and night. They need to eat every few hours, and they depend on you for E-VER-Y-THING. Whether it’s being bounced around, rocked to sleep, or it’s time for their next feed – you’re their whole world.<\/p><p>There’s no doubt that these are wonderful times. But for sleep-deprived parents, these months can be tough. So having your own ‘survival strategy’ for sleepless nights is always a good idea.<\/p><p>We’ve put together our most helpful tips and advice on how to deal with sleep deprivation as a parent, so you can actually <em>enjoy<\/em> your time as a new parent. <\/p><p>First up, let’s take a look at our sleep cycle and how it works.<\/p>",

You’re in bed and have the monitor glued to your ear, waiting for the first tiny noise so you can leap up out of bed to check out what’s going on. <\/p><p>The thing is, newborns are active sleepers. Which means that they’re going to make noise (like little groans and whimpers) in their sleep.<\/p><p>By six months, most babies can sleep seven to eight hours so you can start encouraging them to fall asleep on their own. <\/p><p>So prise the monitor out of your hand and turn it down to an acceptable level. You might be surprised at the results. <br\/><\/p><ul><li><strong>Invest in <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/pages\/earplugs-for-parenting\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>noise-reducing earplugs<\/strong><\/span><\/a><\/li><\/ul><p>Investing in some noise-reducing earplugs can help you turn down the volume of parenting while still being able to hear everything you need to.

Fueling your body with the right foods boosts your metabolism, so start the day with a breakfast brimming with nutrients, and eat a mix of fruit, vegetables, and wholegrains throughout the day.<\/p><p>Try to avoid alcohol and caffeine where you can (we know that morning coffee is non-negotiable) because it can lead to dehydration, which in turn can intensify your fatigue.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Take a nap<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Don’t try to fill your baby-free time with too much. There’s no need to force yourself to be productive. Take the pressure off and take a 20-30-minute nap. This is the ideal length to avoid the groggy feeling you get with an overly long daytime nap. Short daytime naps are the best way to rejuvenate yourself, and to give yourself a headstart for the long night ahead.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Rotate nights <\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>If you have a partner and they work during the day, don’t be tempted to take on the night shifts all by yourself. Doing round-the-clock feedings can lead to serious sleep deprivation. So if you have the option, why not rotate nights? At least one person can recharge and be more helpful the following day. Co-parenting is about working together as a team. <\/p><p>If you’re nursing, you could try pumping breast milk ahead of time, even for a couple of the nighttime feeds. <br\/><\/p><ul><li><strong>Ask for help<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Parenting can be overwhelming. Don’t be afraid to lean on those closest to you. Try calling on a friend to help with childcare or household tasks so you can get some well-earned rest! And don’t feel guilty about it. A good friend will be happy to help wherever they can. <br\/><\/p><ul><li><strong>Create a good sleeping environment (for you and the baby)<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>A cool, quiet, dark environment is ideal for both you and your baby.<\/p><p>Make sure that the temperature is not too hot or too cold – 68-72°F (20-22°C) is ideal.<\/p><p>Also, put some bedtime rituals in place from an early age, such as reading a story or a gentle warm bath before bed.

Get into a comfortable position – it can be sitting or lying down. <\/p><p>2. Close your eyes and breathe slowly, concentrating on your breath. Inhale and exhale slowly and deeply.<\/p><p>3. If a thought pops into your head, imagine letting it go, and refocus your energy on your breathing.<\/p><p>It can take a fair bit of practice, so be patient with yourself. <\/p><p>Start with 5-10 minutes each night, and when you feel like you’ve mastered it, you can increase to 15-20 minutes for optimum effect.<\/p>",
