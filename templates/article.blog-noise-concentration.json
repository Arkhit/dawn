For others, though, they’re completely unable to concentrate with background noise. <\/p><p>It’s clear that background noise can affect concentration – it’s just that it affects each person differently. <\/p><p>It all comes down to how our brains process sounds. The neural networks in our brains have certain processes they must follow to achieve focus and concentration. When there’s background noise, it competes with the brain signals for the things you actually want to focus on. For some people, the signals can get jumbled up, meaning it’s difficult to know what to concentrate on.<\/p><p>Studies have backed this theory up, including one by researchers <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/32196457\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Huang and Elhiali<\/span><\/a>, which asked 81 participants to focus on a repeating sound, while also being exposed to background noises. They found that, when a loud noise happened in the background, the participants were more likely to lose their attention on the task at hand.<\/p><p>They then measured the brain activity of the participants. They found that brain waves synchronized with tones that the participants were focusing on – but once there was a noticeable background noise, the tone synchronization reduced and the brain waves aligned with the background noise. <\/p><p>That means that distracting background noises activate the same region of the brain as sounds that we choose to focus on – and that’s why background noise can be so distracting. Our brains just don’t know what signals are most important. It’s no wonder that it’s so hard to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/blogs\/blog\/how-to-stay-focused-at-work\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">stay focused at work<\/span><\/a> sometimes.<\/p><p>On the other hand, some people do find that working or studying with noise in the background can help them to be more productive. <a href=\"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/like-to-work-with-background-noise-it-could-be-boosting-your-performance-119598\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Some research<\/span><\/a> has found that there is a certain optimal noise level that allows people to perform better – but too much noise impacts performance. <\/p><p>So, it’s all about finding that sweet spot between noise and silence, and finding out what noise helps you focus – or what noise helps your employees to focus, if you’re looking for ways to improve the work environment as an employer.<\/p>",

            "text": "<ul><li><strong>Correcting your hearing loss<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>If your tinnitus is linked to hearing loss, it’s important to address the root cause. If you have hearing loss, your brain may replace the absence of sound with a perceived sound, which manifests as a ringing in your ears.<\/p><p>Addressing this, with a hearing aid for instance, will ensure that your brain isn’t working as hard, which may reduce the effects of tinnitus. It also means that you’ll be better able to hear sounds that you weren’t able to hear before, which may counteract the tinnitus noises.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Tinnitus retraining therapy<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Tinnitus retraining therapy, also known as TRT, helps to retrain your brain. Through a combination of sound therapy and counseling, TRT supports you to tune out the ringing sounds and become less aware of it. This in turn, should help you to become less bothered by it over time.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Sound therapy<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7493236\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">2020 study<\/span><\/a> found that sound therapy can be effective in suppressing tinnitus. This involves exposure to background noises like white noise to mask the symptoms of tinnitus, or to distract you from it. There are several approaches to sound therapy, ranging from simple measures like opening a window to let noises from outside filter in, to using a white noise generator to produce a soothing sound that covers up the ringing in your ears.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Counseling<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>As tinnitus can be debilitating, it can be difficult to deal with it on your own. Talking therapy can help you to better understand your symptoms, and devise strategies to deal with it. <\/p><ul><li><strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy that aims to change a person’s thought patterns. In the case of tinnitus, it challenges one’s ways of thinking about their tinnitus, aiming to retrain their behavior. <\/p><p>Changing the way you think and feel about your tinnitus may not reduce the ringing you hear in your ears, but it can improve your outlook and reduce the impact your tinnitus has on your everyday life.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Self care<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>You may also wish to develop your own toolkit of coping strategies for your tinnitus, which you can pull out whenever you need help. That’s because tinnitus can become worse when you let your health and wellbeing slide. As <strong>Kathleen Wallace<\/strong> explains it:<\/p><p><em>“With tinnitus, it actually becomes more pronounced or more bothersome when people are stressed or when they are tired, or when they haven't eaten well. All of them can cause tinnitus spikes. So just like how noise can become more bothersome and can really result in stress and anxiety and all these things, it's the same thing with tinnitus.”<\/em><\/p><p>Some self care ideas for improving your health and staying on top of your tinnitus include:<\/p><ul><li>Relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga and deep breathing.<\/li><li>Improving your sleep – and your sleep routine. Things like sticking to a regular sleep schedule, avoiding using your phone before bed, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol can help you to get a better night’s sleep, and reduce your tinnitus symptoms.<\/li><li>Finding a hobby you enjoy: this can help to distract you from the irritating ringing you hear in your ears.<\/li><li>Talking and sharing your experience of tinnitus with others in the same position, through a support group.<\/li><\/ul>",
