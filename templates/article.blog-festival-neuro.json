Which artists do you absolutely want to see, which ones would you like to see but it’s not a must, and which ones are you fine with skipping? This clarifies your priorities for taking in stimulus while leaving room for flexibility. I only like certain songs from some artists, so I go to setlist.fm to check whether they’ll be playing that song or not. Of course you also have to take the wishes of your festival companions into account while planning. Pro tip: plan in enough time to decompress as well. <\/p><p><strong>2. Festival map:<\/strong> the feasibility of your dream line-up depends on the festival map. How much time do you need to allow to go from stage A to B? How far do you have to walk? The last thing you need is to get stressed from rushing to hear your favorite song! <\/p><p><strong>3. Food and drinks:<\/strong> healthy meal options aren’t a given at festivals, which can cause stress for some neurodivergents. The day before, give some thought to whether you’re going to watch what you eat that day. Check out which foods are available and when you can plan them, so that your stomach also knows what to expect and you don’t get ambushed by hunger. <\/p><p><strong>4. Know the rules:<\/strong> Every festival has its own rules when it comes to the type of backpacks permitted and what drinks that you can or can’t take in with you. Check these rules in advance to avoid stress! <\/p><p><strong>5. Prep your power pack:<\/strong> I always carry a hip pack (bum bag) with all the essentials: wallet (having taken out all unnecessary cards), a power bank to charge my devices, Loop earplugs, tissues, a rain jacket, sunscreen and sunglasses. <\/p><p><strong>6. Figure out how to get there:<\/strong> I personally avoid public transport like the plague, because it is really a recipe for disaster for my brain. I prefer the cocoon of my own car (or someone else’s). In any case, sort out your means of transport in advance so that you don’t have to worry about it on the day itself. <\/p><p><strong>7. Make a playlist:<\/strong> create a playlist on an app like Spotify to get your tunes flowing and get in the festival mood!  <\/p>",

            "text": "<p>The big day has dawned! Hopefully you are well-prepared so you won’t be too nervous. How do you make sure you get through the day unscathed? I have a few more tips up my sleeve: <\/p><p><strong>1. Choose a festival-proof outfit:<\/strong> work with layers so that you can easily take off or put on clothes to feel comfortable. Put your hair up or wear a hat to keep it out of the way. Personally I avoid jewelry because I don’t want to worry about losing it. My feet can really bug me too: I have flat feet and for some reason my shoelaces always end up untied. That’s why I favor a sturdy pair of sneakers with a velcro closure.  <\/p><p><strong>2. Start a WhatsApp group with your festival companions:<\/strong> there’s nothing as annoying as having to call each other asking “WHERE ARE YOU?”. With a WhatsApp group you not only keep each other posted, you also have more control over when you check your phone. <\/p><p><strong>3. Enjoy downtime meals:<\/strong> if you get there early enough, you can make a beeline for drink and food tickets. Even more important is when you cash them in. I choose to have lunch at atypical times, like 11:30 am or 3:30 pm. Another way to prevent stressful lines and crowds. <\/p><p><strong>4. Pick a strategic spot to watch performances<\/strong>: wait, crowds are stressful? How on earth can I enjoy performances then? Well, during regular concerts I always go for seats. I'm small, so in the middle of the crowd I can’t see well anyway. It's different at festivals. I used to rush to get as far to the front as possible in the morning, but that worked on my nerves more than anything. Now I strategically select a spot along the side, around the middle of the festival site. If I can't see the artists directly myself, I can still see them on the big screens on the side. If it all gets too much for me, I can also quickly escape from the crowd. <\/p><p><strong>5. Take breaks in quiet places: <\/strong>hopefully you’ve planned enough breaks in your schedule, and it’s best to take these in a quiet place. Sometimes I even leave the festival site to rest against a tree truck. A little weird perhaps, but so necessary! <\/p><p><strong>6. Let your eyes and ears adjust right before the festival:<\/strong> I usually put on my sunglasses and earplugs before entering the festival site, so my senses are already used to them. <\/p><p><strong>7. Bow out before the encore:<\/strong> it takes a little discipline, but I always leave the last performance before the end of the set. The last thing I want to do is to get stuck in an exciting flow of thousands of people. Especially if it’s the last performance of the festival: you don’t want to get stuck in a parking lot because everyone wants to leave at the same time, or on the train platform with all the masses piling onto the last train home. <\/p>",

People who suffer from misophonia may be reluctant to put themselves into situations where they experience sounds they find irritating, which could lead to isolation. If the noise of other people eating is a trigger, for example, then you might eat your meals alone in your room, or avoid going to restaurants. That can have a big impact on your social and family life. <\/p>",

Keep it chill:<\/strong> Don’t plan any activities the day after, and nothing big for several days. How long you need to recuperate depends on the individual, so think about how you have handled past stimuli and plan in the chill time you need. <\/p><p><strong>2. Keep it quiet:<\/strong> The less sensory input you have during recuperation time the better, so make sure you can be in a quiet place where you feel comfortable. Festivals can also be socially draining, so also minimize social interactions that require effort for a few days. <\/p><p><strong>3. Think back:<\/strong> Once you’ve recuperated, think about what you enjoyed and what was challenging for you. Take notes for next time, and cherish your festival memories!<\/p>",
