But if it’s your first time, you won’t want your experience to be ruined before you even get started. <\/p><p>It’s always a good idea to pre-order your ticket so you can be sure that you’re going to get in and have an amazing time. <\/p><p>Just remember to actually take your ticket with you! <\/p><p><strong>2. Wear comfy clothes<\/strong><\/p><p>Fashion statements at concerts are a big thing. <\/p><p>People go to gigs and raves in the wildest and most wonderful outfits you could ever want, but style isn’t everything. Because after all, your full neon suit with glittery wings may look incredible, but when you’re at a heavy metal concert in the middle of a mosh pit those wings won’t last long. <\/p><p>You’ll want to make sure your outfit is suitable for the venue. For example, if it’s outside at night, you might want to put some extra layers on, or if it’s outside in the heat you’ll want to make sure you’re wearing loose clothes that won’t make you overheat.<\/p><p>And if your concert is indoors, you’ll want to make sure that you’re wearing clothes that are comfortable and that you won’t overheat in – like a nice comfy T-shirt and jeans. <\/p><p>You should also avoid wearing things like high heels or new shoes that could give you blisters – just your old, comfy, and trusted street shoes will do perfectly. <\/p><p><strong>3. Plan your journey<\/strong><\/p><p>If you’re off to a big venue, then getting there can be a bit of a hassle. <\/p><p>Be sure to research the logistics of getting to your concert. Whether that’s making sure there’s adequate parking if you’re driving, making sure that it can be reached by public transport or finding out if there are any free shuttle services available to take you to and from the venue. <\/p>",

This increases the risk of the earplugs becoming stuck in your ear canals, which is not only painful but potentially dangerous if you don’t remove them properly. <\/p><p>If they become lodged, you can seriously harm the delicate interior of your ear by trying to take them out on your own. So any blockage should be treated by an experienced healthcare professional. <\/p>",
