Her favourite type of magic is comedy magic. Jenny says “if you can make me laugh you’ve won me over. I like quick and funny tricks. A couple of my favourites are The Tiny Plunger and What Your Future Holds. Also I love seeing people be fooled so my favourite trick to watch being demonstrated is Zenner Tech. Love it!” \n\nWhen Jenny’s not at Alakazam she can be found practicing yoga or gardening which she finds very therapeutic."

            "description": "Andy became interested in magic at the age of 10 when he was given the Mark Wilson Course in Magic as a birthday present. Andy found after a short while that it was the close-up and sleight-of-hand branch of magic that he was most drawn to, learning and absorbing everything he could from the writings of Erdnase, Vernon, Marlo and Jennings, and in later years that of Darwin Ortiz, David Roth, Michael Ammar and others.\n\nAlthough still very much interested in close-up and magic in general, he has been drawn more towards gambling themed card performances and card cheating artifice of late. Andy is a member of the prestigious Magic Circle and is proud to be an Associate Member of the Inner Magic Circle with Silver Star as well as a Member of Equity.\n\nAndy’s deep understanding and thoughtful interest in magic reflects in his work and he enjoys inventing, perfecting and also performing new and exciting magic for people everywhere."
