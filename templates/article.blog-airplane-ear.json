            "text": "<p>Here’s how to prevent your ears from popping on a plane: <\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Invest in earplugs<\/strong><\/p><p>Are earplugs safe on a plane? Do earplugs help with airplane pressure? These are common questions that are asked surrounding <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/pages\/earplugs-for-flying\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">earplugs for flying<\/span><\/a>. <\/p><p> <\/p><p>The answer is yes. And we don’t mean the usual cheap, throwaway yellow earplugs. We’re talking about earplugs that are specially designed to safeguard your ears and give them the maximum protection when flying. <\/p><p> <\/p><p>They work to slowly equalize the pressure against your eardrum, protecting the delicate parts of the ear and easing pain and discomfort. <\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/products\/experience-pro\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Loop Experience Plus<\/strong><\/span><\/a> <\/p><p>The Experience Plus earplugs reduce noise by up to 23dB. They work to equalize the pressure in your ear and the new tech means that they won’t block or muffle sound. You’ll still be able to hear everything you need to on board. They’re also ultra-comfortable and fit snugly in your ears, so you won’t have to worry about them falling out. <\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Swallowing or yawning<\/strong> <\/p><p>The main way to prevent airplane ear is to open the eustachian tube as much as possible. When you swallow or yawn, the clicking or popping sound that you hear is a tiny bubble of air that has moved from the back of the nose to the middle ear, via the eustachian tube. Making sure that the eustachian tube is working overtime and open more frequently will give it a greater chance of accommodating the air pressure. <\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Chewing gum or sucking on candy<\/strong> <\/p><p>Both of these actions will stimulate the frequent swallowing that’s needed to help equalize the air pressure. <\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Try the Valsalva maneuver<\/strong> <\/p><p>This handy tip is often used by frequent fliers. Take a big mouthful of air, close your mouth, and then pinch your nose. Then, gently force air out of your mouth until your ears pop. It’s a great way to open up the eustachian tubes. <\/p><p>IMPORTANT NOTE: if you’re sick with a cold or allergies are raging, the Valsalva maneuver is not the one for you, as it could cause a severe ear infection.  <\/p>",
