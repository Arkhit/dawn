Seemingly normal, everyday sounds can seem unbearably loud to people with hyperacusis. This can include things like:<\/p><ul><li>Running water<\/li><li>Rustling papers<\/li><li>People talking<\/li><li>A dog barking<\/li><li>A dishwasher or washing machine mid-cycle<\/li><li>A radio playing in the background<\/li><li>A vacuum cleaner<\/li><\/ul><p>Hyperacusis can make these sounds unpleasant to hear, and for some people, it also causes physical discomfort or even pain. You can experience it in one ear or both ears.<\/p><p>Hyperacusis affects around 1 in every 50,000 people, and not much is known about it. Because it’s such an uncommon condition, hyperacusis definitions vary. One researcher, Dr Richard Tyler, has categorized hyperacusis into four different subtypes: loudness, annoyance, fear, and pain: <\/p><ul><li><strong>Loudness hyperacusis<\/strong> is the definition most people use when talking about the condition. It’s when sounds that seem normal to other people seem very loud to someone with hyperacusis. <\/li><li><strong>Annoyance hyperacusis<\/strong> is when someone has a negative emotional reaction to sounds, similar to misophonia.<\/li><li><strong>Fear hyperacusis<\/strong> causes avoidant behavior, when someone with hyperacusis has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/blogs\/blog\/noise-sensitivity-anxiety\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">noise sensitivity anxiety<\/span><\/a>. This can mean they avoid going places or become anxious when anticipating hearing triggering noises.<\/li><li><strong>Pain hyperacusis <\/strong>is when someone with the condition experiences pain upon hearing low-level sounds that aren’t usually problematic for people.<\/li><\/ul><p><a href=\"https:\/\/journals.lww.com\/thehearingjournal\/Fulltext\/2014\/08000\/Help_for_Hyperacusis__Treatments_Turn_Down.1.aspx\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Dr Tyler has said<\/span><\/a> that there’s a lot of crossover between the four types, and having one kind of hyperacusis may lead to developing another. He said:<\/p><p><em>“If you experience loudness hyperacusis, emotional consequences may follow, leading to stress and annoyance, which eventually lead to fear of going to events and socializing. Pain is a little more complicated because it consists of both a fundamental attribute and an emotional consequence.”<\/em><\/p>",

Although hyperacusis causes discomfort and pain when you hear noises, it’s commonly agreed that it’s not a hearing problem, but instead is to do with how your brain perceives sounds. <\/p><p>We detect sounds as vibrations, and when you have hyperacusis, your brain may perceive certain vibrations to be louder than they actually are. That’s why, when hearing low-level sounds, someone with hyperacusis reacts very differently to them than another person without hyperacusis who hears the same sounds.<\/p><p>In other cases, hyperacusis is a result of an accident or injury, or is a symptom of hearing loss. Other possible causes of hyperacusis include:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Facial nerve damage:<\/strong> The facial nerve controls the stapedius muscle that is responsible for the regulation of sound intensity in the ear. Some people with conditions like Bell’s palsy, Lyme disease and Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which are associated with nerve damage to the face, also have hyperacusis.<\/li><li><strong>Exposure to loud noises:<\/strong> Some people develop hyperacusis as a result of either long-term or sudden exposure to loud noises. That means people who work in settings which expose them to sustained loud noises, like construction workers and musicians, are at risk of developing hyperacusis, as well as people who develop it after hearing a loud sound, like a gunshot or fireworks.<\/li><li><strong>Head or ear injury:<\/strong> For some people, hyperacusis develops after a blow to the head or another type of head injury.<\/li><li><strong>Hearing loss:<\/strong> Hyperacusis can develop alongside hearing loss, usually age-related hearing loss.<\/li><li><strong>Tinnitus: <\/strong>One study found that the occurrence of hyperacusis with severe tinnitus is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7465629\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">as high as 80%<\/span><\/a>.<\/li><li><strong>Facial or jaw surgery:<\/strong> If the ear nerve or facial nerve is damaged during surgery, you’re at risk of developing hyperacusis.<\/li><li><strong>Medication and recreational drugs:<\/strong> Some medications, like cancer drugs, can cause hearing damage and hyperacusis, and some recreational drugs like LSD also increase the risk.<\/li><li><strong>Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder: <\/strong>If you have issues with your TMJ, you may be at risk of developing hyperacusis.<\/li><li><strong>Viral infections: <\/strong>Ear infections that affect the inner ear or facial nerve may cause hyperacusis.<\/li><li><strong>Autism:<\/strong> Research shows that hyperacusis is highly prevalent in people with autism, with one study finding that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8544234\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">46% of children<\/span><\/a> with hyperacusis also had autism. <\/li><li><strong>Autoimmune conditions: <\/strong>People with autoimmune conditions like lupus can develop hearing and balance issues, including hyperacusis, due to inner ear issues.<\/li><li><strong>Emotional stress and mental health issues: <\/strong>High levels of stress, as well as conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression may cause hyperacusis and noise sensitivity.<\/li><\/ul><p>Other conditions associated with hyperacusis include:<\/p><ul><li>Migraines<\/li><li>Tay-Sachs disease<\/li><li>Epilepsy <\/li><li>Myalgic encephalomyelitis or also called chronic fatigue syndrome (ME\/CFS)<\/li><li>Meniere’s disease<\/li><li>Down syndrome<\/li><li>Williams syndrome<\/li><\/ul>",

            "text": "<p>Although there isn’t a cure for the condition, there are several treatments for hyperacusis which can help you to reduce the impact the symptoms have on your life and help you to live a life that’s less stressful. The treatment will depend on the cause of your hyperacusis, but your doctor will be able to recommend which one suits you best. Some of the options include:<br\/><\/p><p><strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy<\/strong><\/p><p>CBT may help people with hyperacusis to manage their responses to sounds that make them feel uncomfortable. When someone with hyperacusis hears a noise that they find distressing or painful, they may experience negative thoughts. This can make the condition worse, either causing them to avoid noisy situations in the future, or intensifying their symptoms, creating a vicious cycle. <\/p><p>CBT helps to break this cycle by helping people with hyperacusis to explore what negative thoughts they have related to sounds, and attempting to change these into more positive or neutral thoughts. This can be particularly helpful if you have fear hyperacusis, as it can help to challenge your avoidant behavior and make you less anxious about going into situations where you might experience noises that cause you discomfort.<\/p><p><strong>Tinnitus retraining therapy<\/strong><\/p><p>Another treatment option that may work for some people with hyperacusis is tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT). This treatment combines sound therapy with counseling to help train your brain to ignore the sounds that cause you discomfort or pain. Over time, it helps you to build more tolerance to these sounds, as your brain places less emphasis on them.<\/p><p><strong>Sound therapy<\/strong><\/p><p>Sound therapy, sometimes called sound desensitization, exposes people with hyperacusis to sounds with the aim of increasing their tolerance over time. It’s done using a noise generator, which is usually a small device that looks like a hearing aid and is worn on both ears, if you have hyperacusis on both sides, or just one ear.<\/p><p>It plays static sound, similar to white noise, and is at a very low level to begin with. It then gradually increases to louder sounds over time as you build up more tolerance. It usually takes between six months and a year for the therapy to have an impact on your hyperacusis. <\/p><p><strong>Lifestyle management<\/strong><\/p><p>Since hyperacusis can get worse when you’re stressed, your doctor may recommend that you try to stay healthy and minimize stress to reduce the effect your hyperacusis has on your life. You could try things like:<\/p><ul><li>Getting regular exercise<\/li><li>Meditation<\/li><li>Ensuring you get enough sleep<\/li><li>Regular massage<\/li><li>Yoga<\/li><li>Maintain a healthy work life balance<\/li><\/ul><p><strong>Surgery<\/strong><\/p><p>A type of surgery called ‘round and oval window reinforcement’ may be an option for some people with the condition, if no other hyperacusis treatments work. This procedure involves moving tissue behind the ear to support the hearing bones, with the aim to reduce your ears’ sensitivity to sound.<\/p>",

If you have hearing loss, your brain may replace the absence of sound with a perceived sound, which manifests as a ringing in your ears.<\/p><p>Addressing this, with a hearing aid for instance, will ensure that your brain isn’t working as hard, which may reduce the effects of tinnitus. It also means that you’ll be better able to hear sounds that you weren’t able to hear before, which may counteract the tinnitus noises.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Tinnitus retraining therapy<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Tinnitus retraining therapy, also known as TRT, helps to retrain your brain. Through a combination of sound therapy and counseling, TRT supports you to tune out the ringing sounds and become less aware of it. This in turn, should help you to become less bothered by it over time.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Sound therapy<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7493236\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">2020 study<\/span><\/a> found that sound therapy can be effective in suppressing tinnitus. This involves exposure to background noises like white noise to mask the symptoms of tinnitus, or to distract you from it. There are several approaches to sound therapy, ranging from simple measures like opening a window to let noises from outside filter in, to using a white noise generator to produce a soothing sound that covers up the ringing in your ears.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Counseling<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>As tinnitus can be debilitating, it can be difficult to deal with it on your own.

So just like how noise can become more bothersome and can really result in stress and anxiety and all these things, it's the same thing with tinnitus.”<\/em><\/p><p>Some self care ideas for improving your health and staying on top of your tinnitus include:<\/p><ul><li>Relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga and deep breathing.<\/li><li>Improving your sleep – and your sleep routine. Things like sticking to a regular sleep schedule, avoiding using your phone before bed, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol can help you to get a better night’s sleep, and reduce your tinnitus symptoms.<\/li><li>Finding a hobby you enjoy: this can help to distract you from the irritating ringing you hear in your ears.<\/li><li>Talking and sharing your experience of tinnitus with others in the same position, through a support group.<\/li><\/ul>",
