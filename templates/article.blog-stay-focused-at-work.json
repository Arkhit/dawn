Important tasks are those that aren’t as time sensitive, and could be done tomorrow or later in the week instead of today, or those that could be delegated instead.<\/p><p>Focus on completing your urgent tasks first, during your highest energy period – that will usually be in the morning, but you may find you have more energy in the late mornings or afternoons. That leaves you to work on tasks that don’t require such intense focus when you have less energy.<\/p><p>You might want to try using the 1-3-5 rule. That means you focus on accomplishing one big thing each day, three medium-sized tasks, and five little ones. If you have one long, to-do list, you may end up becoming disheartened or overwhelmed as it seems never-ending. You’re never going to be able to accomplish everything in one day, as time is limited. Breaking your to-do list down into these nine items makes your to-do list a whole lot more achievable.
