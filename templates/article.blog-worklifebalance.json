This is backed up by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.randstad.co.uk\/about-us\/reports\/work-life-balance-more-important-salary-two-thirds\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">research from Randstad<\/span><\/a>, who found that when looking for a new job, work life balance is the most important factor for 65% of job seekers. It’s so important to potential employees that they rated it ahead of salary, job security, work atmosphere and training opportunities.<\/p><p>So prioritizing work life balance in your workplace will not only help you to retain your existing employees – but it could also help you to attract new ones.<\/p><p>What’s more, employees who are happier are also more productive – there’s even research to prove it. A study from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ox.ac.uk\/news\/2019-10-24-happy-workers-are-13-more-productive\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">University of Oxford<\/span><\/a> found that happier employees are 13% more productive. It also found that they don’t work more hours than their less happy colleagues. It’s simply that they get more done in the time that they have.<\/p><p>So, as an employer, it definitely pays to pay attention to how your staff are feeling. This is something that the HR team at Loop are mindful of. As People Manager Bas Moeyaert explains:<\/p><p><em>\"From a people perspective, we must remember that our employees are like elastic bands. While we can stretch them to reach their full potential, there is a limit to how much we can stretch them. Just like an over-stretched elastic band, an employee who is pushed too far without any consideration for work-life balance will eventually snap. It is our responsibility to ensure that we find the right balance between pushing our employees and giving them the time they need to recharge and avoid burnout.\"<\/em><\/p><p>But how do we promote that work life balance for our employees?

Some like working early in the morning and have a slump in the afternoon. Others are night owls and would rather start work later in the day.<\/p><p>There’s a thousand different reasons why employees require flexible working. Some of your employees will be parents or have caring responsibilities and need flexibility in their work schedule to carry out their tasks. Others might have a hobby that they need to finish work at 3pm on a Wednesday for. Perhaps some are in a long-distance relationship and need to travel when the roads are quieter. Whatever the reasons, flexibility in their employees’ working lives can take the pressure off and improve the balance between their personal and professional commitments.<\/p><p>If you give your employees flexibility at work, it’s more likely that they’ll be willing to be more flexible, too, if there’s a business need for it. After all, as Bas explains:<\/p><p><em>\"At work, as in life, you get what you give. Offering flexibility makes that employees are often more willing to go the extra mile for their company.\"<\/em><\/p><p>There are two main strands to flexible working: allowing your team to work the way they want to, and trusting them to work when they want.<\/p><p>When it comes to working location, do you mandate that all of your employees come into their workplace every day? Or are you a remote-first business? Have you considered what impact your way of working could have on your employees? Let’s have a closer look at ways you can offer more flexible working.<\/p>",

Some people prefer to be surrounded by their colleagues – particularly younger employees. <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/content\/dam\/Deloitte\/global\/Documents\/deloitte-2022-genz-millennial-mh-whitepaper.pdf\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Research carried out by Deloitte<\/span><\/a> states that one in five millennials and Gen Z employees found that remote working made it harder to form connections with colleagues. Additionally, 15% said that working remotely made it harder to find a mentor.<\/p><p>There’s no one answer that applies to all businesses. That’s why it’s important to find out how your employees want to work. Your business model may not work as a fully remote model, or you may want to take advantage of a global workforce which a remote-first model opens up. But you can look at the different options and, hopefully, come up with an optimal solution that works for both you and your employees.<\/p>",

Whether they work 9-5, 12-8 or 4-12, does it really matter, as long as they get the work done? <\/p><p>If it’s evident that your employees aren’t trusted, it can really damage their mental health, productivity, and their overall work life balance. A study, <a href=\"https:\/\/workforceinstitute.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Trust-in-the-Modern-Workplace-Final.pdf\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">‘Trust in the Modern Workplace’<\/span><\/a> by the Workforce Institute found that employees who don’t feel trusted are less productive with 68% saying that their daily output is lower when there’s a lack of trust. <\/p><p>So, consider implementing a more flexible working policy in your business. It may not be possible for your business to offer fully flexible working – you may, for instance, have a customer service function that’s open during standard business hours.

There’s no legal requirement in the USA for businesses to include paid time off in their employees compensation plan. That’s in stark contrast to Europe and the UK. In the UK, most full time workers are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/holiday-entitlement-rights\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">entitled to 28 days holiday<\/span><\/a> per year, which is equivalent to 5.6 weeks, and in the EU, employees have the right to <a href=\"https:\/\/europa.eu\/youreurope\/business\/human-resources\/working-hours-holiday-leave\/working-hours\/index_en.htm\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">at least 4 weeks<\/span><\/a> paid holiday per year.<\/p><p>And yet, vacations are essential for our mental health. Time off allows employees to relax and recharge, with one study from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apadivisions.org\/division-28\/publications\/newsletters\/psychopharmacology\/2017\/07\/vacation\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">American Psychological Association<\/span><\/a> finding that time off reduces stress levels by removing employees from environments they associate with stress and anxiety.<\/p><p>Vacations are good for us – and employees want more of them, with <a href=\"https:\/\/gocity.com\/en-us\/workcations-in-2023\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">86% of Americans<\/span><\/a> saying they wished they had more paid time off, and 1 in 4 stating they wished they had unlimited PTO. So why not offer your employees a more generous amount of vacation leave?<\/p><p>It isn’t the most innovative of ideas for improving work life balance – but it is one of the most successful ones. But it’s only effective when you encourage employees to actually use their PTO.<\/p><p>Even though we all know that vacations are important for our wellbeing, Americans are still failing to take all of their PTO. Research conducted in 2022 by Eagle Hill Consulting found that<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eaglehillconsulting.com\/news\/us-workforce-not-taking-vacation\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"> 42% of US workers<\/span><\/a> haven’t taken a vacation in the last 12 months. They might feel like they have too much to do to take any time off, that they don’t have anyone to hand the work over to, that they’ll be seen as a slacker, or that they won’t be able to relax when they’re on vacation.<\/p><p>As well as addressing the root issues behind your employees not taking their vacation time, you should look at ways to encourage them to take their full PTO allowance. You could add it into yearly performance reviews, send monthly reminders of how many days your staff have left to take, or consider offering unlimited PTO to allow employees to manage their own vacations and workload.<\/p>",

However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7159231\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">one 2020 study<\/span><\/a> did look at comorbidities of misophonia, with a sample of 575 people. They found that 5% of the participants (31 people) also had ADHD, and 3% (14 people) had autism. It’s not definitive evidence, but it does suggest that there could be a link between the two.<\/p><p>People with ADHD are often hypersensitive to sights, smells and sounds, which can be distracting and can cause a strong emotional response. This is because people with ADHD can have difficulty filtering out and processing unnecessary external sensory input. To put it more simply, if you have ADHD, you may struggle when there’s lots going on at once and become overwhelmed. <\/p><p>Let’s say you’re trying to focus on getting some work done. But the people to your left are talking, and the person to your right is eating lunch. There’s also the whirr of the printer behind you, the hiss of the coffee machine and the clattering of plates being loaded into the dishwasher. The sensory overwhelm can lead to feelings of stress, anxiety, anger and disgust, very similar to the feelings triggered by misophonia.<\/p>",
