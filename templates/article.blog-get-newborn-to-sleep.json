It is a treatment that concentrates on the here and now, rather than searching for a root cause in the past in the way that many other therapies do.<\/p><p><em><strong>Exposure therapy<\/strong><\/em><\/p><p>Exposure therapy, or systematic desensitization, is another type of psychotherapy that is regularly utilized when treating people with phonophobia.<\/p><p>It works by using guided and repeated exposure to the phobia in question in order to desensitize the patient. By being exposed to the source of the fear with no ill consequences, it is thought that exposure therapy can help the patient realize that their fear is unwarranted. <\/p><p>While this type of therapy can be upsetting, it’s also proved to be extremely effective with high success rates. <\/p><p>Don’t worry though – a therapist running an exposure therapy session will use a graded approach so that you’re not instantly overwhelmed. <\/p><p>So for example, if you are afraid of mice, the therapist may start a session just by showing you a drawing of a mouse. Then upping the exposure level as you become more and more desensitized to the stimuli. <\/p>",
