People who suffer from misophonia may be reluctant to put themselves into situations where they experience sounds they find irritating, which could lead to isolation. If the noise of other people eating is a trigger, for example, then you might eat your meals alone in your room, or avoid going to restaurants. That can have a big impact on your social and family life. <\/p>",

However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7159231\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">one 2020 study<\/span><\/a> did look at comorbidities of misophonia, with a sample of 575 people. They found that 5% of the participants (31 people) also had ADHD, and 3% (14 people) had autism. It’s not definitive evidence, but it does suggest that there could be a link between the two.<\/p><p>People with ADHD are often hypersensitive to sights, smells and sounds, which can be distracting and can cause a strong emotional response. This is because people with ADHD can have difficulty filtering out and processing unnecessary external sensory input. To put it more simply, if you have ADHD, you may struggle when there’s lots going on at once and become overwhelmed. <\/p><p>Let’s say you’re trying to focus on getting some work done. But the people to your left are talking, and the person to your right is eating lunch. There’s also the whirr of the printer behind you, the hiss of the coffee machine and the clattering of plates being loaded into the dishwasher. The sensory overwhelm can lead to feelings of stress, anxiety, anger and disgust, very similar to the feelings triggered by misophonia.<\/p>",
