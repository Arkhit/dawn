If they can be given to someone else, it could be a great development opportunity for them, while freeing up more of your time.<\/p><p>You could also try using the <a href=\"https:\/\/pomofocus.io\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Pomodoro Technique<\/span><\/a> to boost your productivity. This is a technique that helps you to keep your focus by chunking your time into 30 minute blocks. You work on a task for 25 minutes, then take a break for 5 minutes. That means you’re not tempted by any distractions in the 25 minutes of focused time – it’s best to put your phone away while using the Pomodoro Technique – and you might be surprised by how much you can get done.<\/p><p>Creating a work life balance isn’t an immediate solution. It may take you some time to understand what challenges you face, both in your work and personal life, as well as which of our work life balance tips help you to find the equilibrium you need. <\/p><p>But you can get there!
