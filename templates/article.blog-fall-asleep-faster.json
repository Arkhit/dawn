It is a treatment that concentrates on the here and now, rather than searching for a root cause in the past in the way that many other therapies do.<\/p><p><em><strong>Exposure therapy<\/strong><\/em><\/p><p>Exposure therapy, or systematic desensitization, is another type of psychotherapy that is regularly utilized when treating people with phonophobia.<\/p><p>It works by using guided and repeated exposure to the phobia in question in order to desensitize the patient. By being exposed to the source of the fear with no ill consequences, it is thought that exposure therapy can help the patient realize that their fear is unwarranted. <\/p><p>While this type of therapy can be upsetting, it’s also proved to be extremely effective with high success rates. <\/p><p>Don’t worry though – a therapist running an exposure therapy session will use a graded approach so that you’re not instantly overwhelmed. <\/p><p>So for example, if you are afraid of mice, the therapist may start a session just by showing you a drawing of a mouse. Then upping the exposure level as you become more and more desensitized to the stimuli. <\/p>",

And when this happens, it’s a clear sign that you need to use up some of that extra energy throughout the day. <\/p><p>Any doctor will tell you that exercise is good for you. But not only does it help with the general upkeep and healthiness of your body, it also can help you sleep better at night. <\/p><p>Even moderate levels of exercise can do wonders for both your body and your mind – so you don’t need to go full-out with four-hour gym sessions. Something as simple as a light jog or a midday walk can improve your sleeping pattern. <\/p><p>That being said, make sure that you’re not exercising too close to your bedtime. You should leave at least an hour between your workout and settling down for the night.<\/p>",
