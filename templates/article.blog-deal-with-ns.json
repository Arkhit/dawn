For those who are triggered by noise, whether hypersensitive, neurodivergent or suffering from an auditory disorder, it has been a calmer time. Now that we’re once again free to go outside and be exposed to auditory stimuli, our brains are more likely to be overloaded. For many people this means a lot of anxiety and overwhelm, putting a damper on their daily lives. So how do we deal with noise sensitivity post-lockdown?
