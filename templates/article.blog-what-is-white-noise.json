We might need to break that down a little further!<\/p><p>The term ‘white noise’ refers to a particular noise that contains all of the frequencies of sound that the human ear can hear. That means all frequencies between 20 hertz and 20,000 hertz. They’re all played together at an equal intensity, to create a hissing, whirring or ‘shhh’ noise that’s sometimes described as being similar to TV static. It’s also similar to the noise an untuned radio makes, as well as a hairdryer, a vacuum cleaner, or the sound of an air conditioner.<\/p><p>It’s called white noise as it works in a similar way to white light. White light is a type of light that blends together all of the colors in the color spectrum. As white light is a combination of all the wavelengths of color, white noise is a combination of all the frequencies of sound.<\/p>",

That’s the clever thing about white noise. When there are one or two sounds, your brain can pick them out. That’s a good thing when you’re having a conversation with friends or trying to focus on a presentation at work. But it becomes a problem when you’re lying in bed and can’t focus on anything but the thudding bass leaking through the wall as your neighbor has a party, or the sound of people chatting outside your window.<\/p><p>But something funny happens when you mix many sounds together. When there are lots of sounds all at once, it suddenly becomes difficult for your brain to pick out any one noise in particular.

However, it reduces the power of sounds at higher frequencies and increases the power of sounds at lower frequencies to create a more even sound. It could be compared to steady rainfall, the lapping of waves on a beach, or water trickling down a waterfall.<\/p><p>While some people find white noise soothing, others find it unsettling. Pink noise is more widely considered to be therapeutic.<\/p><p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fnhum.2017.00109\/full\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">small 2017 study<\/span><\/a> looked at whether pink noise helped memory and recall in older adults. The study involved 13 adults aged 60 and older, who took a memory test in the evening before bed two consecutive nights. On both nights, they went to sleep wearing an electrode cap and headphones, and upon waking they repeated the memory test. One night, they listened to pink noise while they slept, and no sound was played on the other night.<\/p><p>It was found that the participants performed three times better in the memory task after listening to pink noise throughout the night compared to their previous night’s test, while the test results didn’t improve as much on the night they didn’t listen to anything. That suggests that, when listened to at the right time, pink noise could be a good aid for study and work.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7986458\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Research<\/span><\/a> from 2020 backed up these findings. Participants were exposed to different types of noise: red, pink and white, as well as a quiet environment. While being exposed to each type of noise, the participants were tested on their:<\/p><ul><li>psychomotor speed (speed of thinking and the speed of movement related to cognitive function)<\/li><li>continuous performance (sustained and selective attention)<\/li><li>executive function (the ability to plan ahead and set goals)<\/li><li>working memory<\/li><\/ul>",

Finally, red and pink noise increased the participants’ ability to make good judgements.<\/p><p>So, it sounds like pink noise is a great choice for improved focus, memory and decision-making. Like white noise, it can also help you to drift off to sleep faster.<\/p><p>Brown noise – also called red noise – works in a similar way to both white and pink noise, but low-frequency sounds are more intense than in the other two types of noise. Most of the higher frequencies that can make white noise sound harsh, or distracting for some people, are removed. That results in a sound that’s more pleasant to listen to.<\/p><p>Brown noise is much deeper than white noise and it sounds like a rumbling noise. It could be compared to a heavy rainfall or a strong power shower.<\/p><p>When it comes to white noise vs brown noise, it really comes down to personal preference. As already mentioned, there is some research to show that brown or red noise can be beneficial for decision-making, memory and psychomotor speed, and it’s also been shown that it can be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tinnitusjournal.com\/articles\/effects-of-tinnitus-retraining-therapy-with-different-colours-of-sound-8932.html\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">beneficial for people with tinnitus<\/span><\/a>.

            "text": "<p>There are, of course, always two sides to every story. When it comes to white noise to help sleep, there are some experts who suggest that it may do more harm than good. <\/p><p>The main concern is that, while using white noise as a sleep aid may help you to drift off faster, it may not allow your auditory system to fully shut down overnight. Listening is an active process that requires your brain to do some work, even in the case of white noise. That means your auditory system may not get a chance to rest and regenerate overnight. However, more research is needed into the impact of this.<\/p><p>Another issue is that white noise could impact your auditory system’s ability to function, over time. <a href=\"https:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamaotolaryngology\/article-abstract\/2697852\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">One study<\/span><\/a> found that when used for long periods of time for sleep or for managing tinnitus, white noise can impair the central auditory system in the brain. It found that white noise can make the brain less sensitive to individual sounds over time, meaning that the brain may end up finding it more difficult to block our irrelevant sounds and we might find it harder to focus on particular sounds when it’s noisy, like trying to have a conversation when there is a lot of background noise.<\/p><p>This study suggests that, while white noise can be beneficial in the short-term, it might not be such a good idea in the long term.<\/p><p>The other issue with white noise is that you could run the risk of hearing damage if you don’t control the volume. You risk possible hearing damage after being exposed to sounds that are 80 decibels or over for more than 8 hours without hearing protection. That level of noise is roughly equivalent to a busy downtown street – so if you’re trying to mask the sound of a busy street outside, it could be tempting to turn your white noise machine or app up even louder than that.<\/p><p>So, does white noise help you sleep? It can do, but it’s important to be aware of how loud you’re listening to it! How loud should white noise be, then? Ensure you’re listening at levels no higher than 50 decibels, which is roughly equivalent to the level of a quiet refrigerator humming or a quiet conversation. <\/p><p>You may also want to use earplugs for additional protection. Earplugs like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/products\/quiet\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Loop Quiet<\/span><\/a> offer up to 27 decibels of noise reduction, reducing the noises that keep you up at night while protecting your ears. You might even find that you can fall asleep with the earplugs alone, and don’t need to use white noise after all.<\/p>",
