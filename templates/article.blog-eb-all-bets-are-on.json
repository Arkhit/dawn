By strategic, we mean location-wise and how noisy the area was.<\/p><p>Hence, this project was perfect for a busy shopping street and the Metropolis cinema complex. Choosing a place where people usually don't realize they're overwhelmed by noise added another layer making it even stronger.<\/p><p>Sparking curiosity was vital; the next step was to see how many people would be drawn to scan the QR code. Once scanned, the code would lead to a webpage with a video about the emotion of sound and how it can reflect and affect emotions.<\/p><p>Pauline De Naeyer, one of the colleagues who worked on this bet, said, \"We had no idea how many people would scan the QR code or what their reactions would be, but that was part of the excitement. It was a huge learning experience, and we were happy to see people intrigued with the video.\"<\/p><p>A highlight from this eco-friendly project was that the company was able reuse the QR code panels to set up in other major cities in the future.<\/p><p>The big pay-off can be seen revenue-wise but also within the company. Damien noted, \"Bets push me to come up with new ideas and work in different fields that I'm not used to working in. I can also bring my expertise to other teams.\"<\/p><h3>Taking a bet on the US market<\/h3><p>Another bet created was a discount code scheme that Ludovic Diercxsens, Maksim Tokarev, and Jasmin Mirpuri pulled together. The group presented their idea to give military personnel, emergency responders, medical personnel, educators, and students 25% off codes.<\/p><p>Based on the premise that many US businesses provide this kind of discount, the goal was to determine whether these demographics in the US market would be interested.<\/p><p>This bet was a win-win because it allowed us to thank community members and increase sales. The project was successful since information could be extracted to guide future marketing and sales strategies.<\/p><h3>Bets in a nutshell<\/h3><p>Loop has taken a tip from Silicon Valley and built a corporate culture around bets. Taking the first step is where it all starts, and that crucial first step helps everything else take off. Giving everyone at Loop the space to experiment and even fail is at the core of Loop's values.<\/p><p>The result is a more agile, iterative, and collaborative approach that builds on strengths and bolsters weak spots. This year, we’re aiming high with the hopes of achieving 100 bets to catapult Loop’s mission even further. Bets make Loop a stronger company in the long run, keeping enthusiasm high and expectations geared toward learning—but most importantly better working together.<\/p>",
