Raves were commonly held as an illegal activity in large, abandoned warehouses or underground clubs. <\/p><p>Throughout the 2000s, it was common for large illegal raves to be raided by law enforcement as public scrutiny of these large-scale parties increased. This ended up having the opposite desired effect as the taboo nature of the underground scene only led more and more people to join in and attend. <\/p><p>Raves were often synonymous with the use of illegal drugs, which led to even more public scrutiny and further trouble with the police. <\/p><p>In modern times, raves have become far more mainstream, with major events being held in cities all around the world; some are even held in large commercial stadiums. <\/p><p>However, although raves are a lot more common now, they still tend to have an air of mystery.

However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nceh\/hearing_loss\/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency,prevent%20noise%2Dinduced%20hearing%20loss.\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">CDC recommends<\/span><\/a> maintaining noise levels below 70 decibels over a 24-hour period, or 75 decibels over an eight-hour period, to prevent noise-induced hearing loss. <\/p><p>This means that if your rave is reaching 120 decibels, you’re exposing your ears to noise around 50 decibels over the recommended safety limit – and with noise-induced hearing loss a real possibility, you’ll want to make sure that you’re taking care of your ears while still enjoying your night. <\/p><p>That’s why we recommend wearing noise-reducing earplugs such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/products\/experience\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Loop Experience<\/span><\/a>. <\/p><p>Loop earplugs allow you to take your world of sound into your own hands by giving you the ability to properly experience your music while also protecting yourself. <\/p><p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/products\/experience\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Experience<\/span><\/a> earplugs allow you to reduce noise levels by up to 18 decibels, with special filter technology that allows you to still hear sounds with perfect clarity. This means that you can fully immerse yourself in the beat of the music without having to sacrifice the health of your ears. <\/p><p>And for those who pack light, Loop earplugs come in a handy small carry case that can easily slip into your pocket or bag, or even attach to your keychain.<\/p>",
