Usually, it’s more than capable of interpreting all of the different information it receives from your body and your surroundings, and is able to tell you how to react.<\/p><p>But sometimes, when there’s lots of sensory information to interpret all at once, your brain can’t deal with it. Different things can trigger sensory overload in different ways for different people. Some of the most common causes are:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Auditory<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>For some people, overstimulation happens when they’re surrounded by lots of different noises, particularly loud noises. That might happen when at a concert or in a nightclub, or at a big football game. It could also be as a result of hearing different sounds at once, for example trying to have a conversation with someone while there is background noise in a restaurant.<\/p><p>Imagine you’re sitting in a cafe, trying to enjoy your latte and your book. But there’s music playing. There’s a couple arguing loudly at the next table. A baby crying over there. The coffee machine is constantly hissing and whirring. Someone’s on a work call. And you can’t concentrate. Maybe you start to become agitated by all the different sounds. <\/p><p>If that sounds familiar, then you may be experiencing sensory overload, triggered by sounds.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Touch<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>For others, it’s not noise but touch that leads to feelings of overwhelm. Certain fabrics, like velvet or cotton, might make you feel uncomfortable, or you might bristle when people touch you or brush by you.<\/p><p>If you’ve ever felt uncomfortable while standing on a crowded bus because strangers are pressed up against you, or someone brushes against your hand when trying to find a place to stand – your sensory overload may be triggered by touch.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Light<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Bright lights can be triggering for some people with sensory issues. This could be the glare of car headlights, flashing strobe lights in a theater show, or harsh strip lighting in an open-plan office or university library.<\/p><p>Picture the scene: You’re trying to get some work done but the lights are glaring above your head. You just can’t seem to focus on anything. Your head starts to hurt. Maybe you’re starting to feel fidgety, or you’re becoming restless. You may be feeling anxious or even angry. Your sensory overload could be triggered by light.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Smell<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Strong smells can cause sensory overload for some people. You might struggle with strong scents like perfume, cleaning products or certain foods – which could lead you to avoiding places where you might encounter these smells, like kitchens, bathrooms, or specific restaurants.<\/p><p>Maybe you can’t bear the smell of bleach, and actively avoid going into bathrooms and kitchens in case they’ve recently been cleaned. Or maybe you find filling your car up with gas a real chore, because the smell is so strong that you start to feel a bit funny. If any of these situations ring true for you, then you may have sensory issues that are triggered by smell.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Taste<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Specific foods can trigger sensory overload, usually ones with a very strong taste. Some people are also sensitive to food that is particularly hot or particularly cold.<\/p><p>Your child may be a picky eater. But they’re not just fussy – it’s that every time you give them broccoli, they gag or vomit. They might only want to eat very bland foods, or maybe they refuse to eat different types of food if they touch on the plate. All of these are signs of sensory overload that is triggered by taste.<\/p>",

In fact, it’s thought to affect anywhere from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4918912\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">69% to 93%<\/span><\/a> of all adults and children with autism. Sensory overload is so common with autism that it’s included as part of the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). <\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/31230465\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">One study<\/span><\/a>, looking at children with ASD and neurotypical children, found that the high prevalence of sensory overload in people with autism could be down to the fact that the brains of the autistic children didn’t adapt to repeated touch or sound. <\/p><p>In neurotypical people, sensory stimuli like noises, textures, smells and lights trigger something in the part of the brain that processes sensory information. If the noise, touch or smell keeps on going, the brain is able to tune it out, so that it can focus on any new information being received. This is a process called habituation, and it allows people to filter out sensations that are unimportant to them. They might know that there’s an ongoing noise in the background, or that they can still feel a scratchy wool sweater on our skin, but their brain allows them to turn down how loud that sensation is for them.<\/p><p>But, the study found, some autistic people don’t have this habituation, meaning they’re more sensitive to sensory stimulation.<\/p><p>That means people with autism can be particularly sensitive to their environments and what’s going on around them, which means they may struggle with sensory overload or hypersensitivity. <\/p><ul><li><strong>ADHD<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>People with ADHD can also struggle with sensory overload, because their brains struggle to process lots of different sensory stimuli at once. If you have ADHD, this means that your brain may not be able to filter out the less important information so you can focus on what you need to – and that can leave you feeling overwhelmed and paralyzed.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fnint.2019.00040\/full\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">One study<\/span><\/a> found that people with ADHD are more likely to struggle with sensory input than people without ADHD – so if you do get sensory overload, know that you’re not alone!<\/p><p>Many of the symptoms of ADHD in themselves can also lead to sensory overload, or make it worse. These include:<\/p><ul><li>Inattentiveness<\/li><li>Difficulty concentrating<\/li><li>Difficulty self-regulation emotions<\/li><li>Hyperactivity <\/li><li>Hyper-focus<\/li><li>Impulsiveness<\/li><li>Lack of awareness of your environment<\/li><\/ul><p>If you struggle with any of these symptoms, it makes it more likely that things like loud noises, bright lights or strong smells may creep up on you unexpectedly – leaving your brain unable to deal with the changes, and leaving you feeling upset or overwhelmed.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Anxiety<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>General anxiety disorder and sensory overload seem to go hand-in-hand. If you already feel anxious, then you may be more prone to experiencing sensory overload in certain situations, like loud concerts or big groups of people. Additionally, if you’re feeling stressed and tired, this can make it more likely that you’ll react badly to sensory stimulation.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Post-traumatic stress disorder<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and sensory overload often co-exist. If you’ve suffered a traumatic event in the past, your brain is hypervigilant to the possibility of it happening again. A veteran with PTSD, for example, may experience sensory overload when they hear loud noises and bright lights. <\/p><p>Sensory overload can also be linked to medical conditions that cause physical pain, including:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Fibromyalgia<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Fibromyalgia is a condition which causes pain all over the body. It’s not known what causes fibromyalgia, but it’s thought that it’s down to certain chemicals in the brain and differences in the way the central nervous system processes pain messages. <\/p><p>People with fibromyalgia often experience sensory overload, although <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinicproceedings.org\/article\/S0025-6196(11)64407-8\/fulltext\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">researchers are still working<\/span><\/a> to establish what the link between the two is.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Multiple sclerosis<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that affects the brain and spinal cord. It commonly causes symptoms like fatigue, difficulty walking, balance problems, vision problems, and problems with thinking and planning. It can also cause sensory overload. If you have MS, you might have trouble thinking or become confused when there’s too much noise around you.<\/p>",

However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7159231\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">one 2020 study<\/span><\/a> did look at comorbidities of misophonia, with a sample of 575 people. They found that 5% of the participants (31 people) also had ADHD, and 3% (14 people) had autism. It’s not definitive evidence, but it does suggest that there could be a link between the two.<\/p><p>People with ADHD are often hypersensitive to sights, smells and sounds, which can be distracting and can cause a strong emotional response. This is because people with ADHD can have difficulty filtering out and processing unnecessary external sensory input. To put it more simply, if you have ADHD, you may struggle when there’s lots going on at once and become overwhelmed. <\/p><p>Let’s say you’re trying to focus on getting some work done. But the people to your left are talking, and the person to your right is eating lunch. There’s also the whirr of the printer behind you, the hiss of the coffee machine and the clattering of plates being loaded into the dishwasher. The sensory overwhelm can lead to feelings of stress, anxiety, anger and disgust, very similar to the feelings triggered by misophonia.<\/p>",
