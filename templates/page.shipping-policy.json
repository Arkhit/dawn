Therefore, the timing for the second box depends on the date of the initial order. Using January as an example, here are the explanations for two patterns:<br/><br/><strong>Pattern 1)</strong> If you order the first subscription box between January 1st 00:00 and January 15th 23:59, the first box will be shipped within 2 weeks, and the second box will be shipped around February 25th, the third box around March 25th, and so forth.<br/><br/><strong>Pattern 2)</strong> If you order the first subscription box between January 16th 00:00 and January 31st 23:59, the first box will be shipped within 2 weeks, and the second box around March 25th , the third box around April 25th, and so forth.<br/><br/>All orders are processed in Japan Standard Time(JST).</p>",
