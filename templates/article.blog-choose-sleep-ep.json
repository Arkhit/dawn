However, foam earplugs can vary a great deal in size and shape – and quality – meaning it’s often difficult to find a pair that fits your ears comfortably, which can have a big impact on your ability to sleep. When using foam earplugs for sleeping, it’s also very easy for them to be pushed too far into your ear canal. At best, this is uncomfortable and can disrupt sleep, and with repeated use it can cause a buildup of earwax. At worst, it can physically damage the inside of your ear, potentially leading to pain and infection. <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Also, while foam earplugs are the most common and usually the cheapest type of earplugs, they are not necessarily the best option. There are several different types of earplugs for sleeping, all with different noise-reducing properties, materials, and pricing. The most common material, besides foam, is silicone. For many people, silicone earplugs are more comfortable to use while sleeping. <\/p>",
