If the holes are on the larger side, they’ll need a bit more attention, but can be sealed using a patch and resin. Check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jBwkQ42__xU\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">tutorial on YouTube<\/span><\/a> to find out how to do this.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Replace your muffler<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Is your motorcycle suddenly sounding louder than usual? <\/p><p>Your muffler might need replacing. Luckily, mufflers are easy to get hold of and don’t cost too much, so you can replace it with minimal hassle.<\/p><p>Alternatively, you might consider changing the type of muffler you’re using. Most motorcycles come with a standard muffler called a bullet muffler, and they’re well-known for making a motorcycle too noisy.<\/p><p>Resonator mufflers are a great choice for keeping the noise at a low level. These models usually feature fiberglass construction on the interior, making them extra soundproof.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Wrap the pipes<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p><strong>\t<\/strong>You’ll be surprised at the effect of pipe wrapping. <\/p><p>\t<\/p><p>Not only does it reduce vibrations coming from your exhaust, but it also employs durable materials such as titanium, which means it’ll hold up well against the high temperatures coming from your bike exhaust. It’s also pretty affordable and easy to install yourself, meaning you’ll be wrapping your pipes like a pro.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Invest in an exhaust silencer<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>A typical silencer works by narrowing the hole of the exhaust using fiberglass wraps, therefore providing a good level of soundproofing.<\/p><p>Again, fitting a silencer doesn’t require any special skills. You just need to get it in place, fasten the screws, and you’re done!<\/p><ul><li><strong>Switch to new pipes<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Sometimes, if there are too many issues, it’s easier to just invest in some new pipes.<\/p><p>If your bike has a dual-exhaust system, it’s a good idea to install crossover pipes. These do an amazing job at suppressing the noise. <\/p><p>There are also other options to choose from, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pipsisland.com\/y-pipe-vs-h-pipe\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Y-pipe or H-pipe designs. <\/span><\/a>It works by equalizing the flow of exhaust gas coming from the engine, which results in better performance and improved sound quality.<\/p>",

It is a treatment that concentrates on the here and now, rather than searching for a root cause in the past in the way that many other therapies do.<\/p><p><em><strong>Exposure therapy<\/strong><\/em><\/p><p>Exposure therapy, or systematic desensitization, is another type of psychotherapy that is regularly utilized when treating people with phonophobia.<\/p><p>It works by using guided and repeated exposure to the phobia in question in order to desensitize the patient. By being exposed to the source of the fear with no ill consequences, it is thought that exposure therapy can help the patient realize that their fear is unwarranted. <\/p><p>While this type of therapy can be upsetting, it’s also proved to be extremely effective with high success rates. <\/p><p>Don’t worry though – a therapist running an exposure therapy session will use a graded approach so that you’re not instantly overwhelmed. <\/p><p>So for example, if you are afraid of mice, the therapist may start a session just by showing you a drawing of a mouse. Then upping the exposure level as you become more and more desensitized to the stimuli. <\/p>",
