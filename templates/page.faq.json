Ever come home from a concert or festival with that <strong>ringing, pounding sound and sensation<\/strong> in your ears? That’s a tell-tale sign of <strong>hearing damage<\/strong>.

They do this by reducing decibel intake while preserving crystal-clear sound quality. This is thanks to their innovative design around an acoustic channel. You don't need to worry that you won’t be able to chat with friends between sets.  You can also personalize your Loops. Add colorful Ear tips and Loop Mute for added decibel coverage. Everything we design aims to not only protect your hearing, but to elevate your experience. And your look, too. And Loops never get uncomfortable. So you can wear them all day long – or store them in their special carry case when needed. All our products are tested and certified in Germany. <\/p>",
