WAGASHI are Japanese traditional sweets that are often served with green tea. Compared to Western confectioneries, WAGASHI uses less oil, spices, and dairy products, and is characterized by the use of grains such as rice and wheat, beans such as azuki and soybeans, and sugar as the main ingredients.
