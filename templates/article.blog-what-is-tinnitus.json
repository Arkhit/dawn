There are delicate hair cells in your inner ear, known as cochlea, that move when you receive sound waves. This movement triggers electrical signals which your brain interprets as sounds. As we age, the cochlea starts to break naturally, which not only leads to hearing loss, but can also result in tinnitus, as your brain is exposed to random electrical signals.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Noise-related hearing loss<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Hearing loss can also occur as a result of exposure to loud noises, either over a prolonged period or as the result of a one-time exposure to a single loud blast of sound. This type of hearing loss also impacts the structures in the inner ear, and it can also cause tinnitus. With both types of hearing loss, tinnitus tends to follow the pattern of how you hear. If you have hearing loss only in one ear, then you’ll usually also only get tinnitus in one ear.<\/p><p><\/p><ul><li><strong>Ear canal blockage<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>If your ear canal gets blocked, whether that’s through an infection, a buildup of earwax, dirt or other foreign materials, the pressure inside your ear can change. This can have an impact on your ability to hear, as well as causing tinnitus.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Sinus infections<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>If you’ve had a cold, you might notice you’re left with a ringing in your ears. This can be caused by an infection that increases the pressure in your ears or sinuses, leading to a case of tinnitus. It should usually only last for a week or so and not cause any long-lasting damage.<\/p>",

They’re known as ototoxic drugs, and they can cause hearing loss, ringing in the ear or trouble balancing. There are over 200 known ototoxic medicines, which include chemotherapy drugs, some antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), quinine and antimalarials. With some of these medications, hearing loss can be reversed when the course is discontinued, while for other drugs, the hearing damage is permanent – but your healthcare provider will always weigh up the risks and benefits when prescribing ototoxic medication.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Problems with your jaw<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>If you have issues with your jaw or temporomandibular joint (TMJ), you may also find that you have issues with tinnitus. That’s because the TMJ shares some nerves and ligaments with your middle ear. You might find that you’re able to alter the intensity of your tinnitus by moving the position of your jaw, but your dentist should be able to treat your TMJ disorder and prevent your tinnitus from getting worse.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Ménière's disease<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>This is a rare condition that affects the inner ear, that can cause a feeling of pressure inside the ear and cause hearing loss, vertigo and tinnitus. People who suffer from this condition will experience some or all of these symptoms in a sudden attack that usually lasts two to three hours, although the effects can remain for a day or two after symptoms subside.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Problems with your blood pressure<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Certain conditions that affect your blood pressure, like high blood pressure, can change the way blood flows through your veins and arteries, causing it to move with more force. This can cause tinnitus, or if you already have tinnitus, it can make the ringing in your ears more noticeable.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Head or neck injuries<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Trauma to the head or neck can affect your inner ear, hearing nerves or the brain functions that are linked to hearing. If you have an accident or a blow to the head, you’ll usually only experience tinnitus in the ear that’s been affected.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Anemia<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Anemia, or iron deficiency, can lead to tinnitus. That’s because iron helps your blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs around your body, and when you’re lacking iron, your arteries may pump harder in order to deliver more blood. This results in pulsatile tinnitus, when you can hear your heartbeat in your ears.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Acoustic neuroma<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>This rare, non-cancerous tumor, can affect the hearing nerve of your inner ear, causing tinnitus.<\/p>",

If you have hearing loss, your brain may replace the absence of sound with a perceived sound, which manifests as a ringing in your ears.<\/p><p>Addressing this, with a hearing aid for instance, will ensure that your brain isn’t working as hard, which may reduce the effects of tinnitus. It also means that you’ll be better able to hear sounds that you weren’t able to hear before, which may counteract the tinnitus noises.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Tinnitus retraining therapy<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Tinnitus retraining therapy, also known as TRT, helps to retrain your brain. Through a combination of sound therapy and counseling, TRT supports you to tune out the ringing sounds and become less aware of it. This in turn, should help you to become less bothered by it over time.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Sound therapy<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7493236\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">2020 study<\/span><\/a> found that sound therapy can be effective in suppressing tinnitus. This involves exposure to background noises like white noise to mask the symptoms of tinnitus, or to distract you from it. There are several approaches to sound therapy, ranging from simple measures like opening a window to let noises from outside filter in, to using a white noise generator to produce a soothing sound that covers up the ringing in your ears.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Counseling<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>As tinnitus can be debilitating, it can be difficult to deal with it on your own. Talking therapy can help you to better understand your symptoms, and devise strategies to deal with it. <\/p><ul><li><strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy that aims to change a person’s thought patterns. In the case of tinnitus, it challenges one’s ways of thinking about their tinnitus, aiming to retrain their behavior. <\/p><p>Changing the way you think and feel about your tinnitus may not reduce the ringing you hear in your ears, but it can improve your outlook and reduce the impact your tinnitus has on your everyday life.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Self care<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>You may also wish to develop your own toolkit of coping strategies for your tinnitus, which you can pull out whenever you need help. That’s because tinnitus can become worse when you let your health and wellbeing slide. As <strong>Kathleen Wallace<\/strong> explains it:<\/p><p><em>“With tinnitus, it actually becomes more pronounced or more bothersome when people are stressed or when they are tired, or when they haven't eaten well. All of them can cause tinnitus spikes. So just like how noise can become more bothersome and can really result in stress and anxiety and all these things, it's the same thing with tinnitus.”<\/em><\/p><p>Some self care ideas for improving your health and staying on top of your tinnitus include:<\/p><ul><li>Relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga and deep breathing.<\/li><li>Improving your sleep – and your sleep routine. Things like sticking to a regular sleep schedule, avoiding using your phone before bed, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol can help you to get a better night’s sleep, and reduce your tinnitus symptoms.<\/li><li>Finding a hobby you enjoy: this can help to distract you from the irritating ringing you hear in your ears.<\/li><li>Talking and sharing your experience of tinnitus with others in the same position, through a support group.<\/li><\/ul>",

            "text": "<p>One of the most common causes of tinnitus is hearing loss – and while some hearing loss can’t be prevented, much of it can. <\/p><p>Let’s take musicians as an example. Musicians are <a href=\"https:\/\/hearinghealthfoundation.org\/hearing-loss-tinnitus-statistics\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">400% more likely<\/span><\/a> to have hearing loss than the general public, and 57% more likely to have tinnitus. <\/p><p>But it’s not just musicians who suffer from tinnitus – people who listen to music, both at concerts and through earbuds (most of us, then!) are also at a high risk of losing their hearing and developing tinnitus. Research has shown that nearly 50% of people aged 12-35 could be exposed to unsafe noise from personal listening devices, and 40% of people in the same age group could be exposed to damaging levels of noise at concerts.<\/p>",
