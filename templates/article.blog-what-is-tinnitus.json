There are delicate hair cells in your inner ear, known as cochlea, that move when you receive sound waves. This movement triggers electrical signals which your brain interprets as sounds. As we age, the cochlea starts to break naturally, which not only leads to hearing loss, but can also result in tinnitus, as your brain is exposed to random electrical signals.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Noise-related hearing loss<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Hearing loss can also occur as a result of exposure to loud noises, either over a prolonged period or as the result of a one-time exposure to a single loud blast of sound. This type of hearing loss also impacts the structures in the inner ear, and it can also cause tinnitus. With both types of hearing loss, tinnitus tends to follow the pattern of how you hear. If you have hearing loss only in one ear, then you’ll usually also only get tinnitus in one ear.<\/p><p><\/p><ul><li><strong>Ear canal blockage<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>If your ear canal gets blocked, whether that’s through an infection, a buildup of earwax, dirt or other foreign materials, the pressure inside your ear can change. This can have an impact on your ability to hear, as well as causing tinnitus.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Sinus infections<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>If you’ve had a cold, you might notice you’re left with a ringing in your ears. This can be caused by an infection that increases the pressure in your ears or sinuses, leading to a case of tinnitus. It should usually only last for a week or so and not cause any long-lasting damage.<\/p>",

They’re known as ototoxic drugs, and they can cause hearing loss, ringing in the ear or trouble balancing. There are over 200 known ototoxic medicines, which include chemotherapy drugs, some antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), quinine and antimalarials. With some of these medications, hearing loss can be reversed when the course is discontinued, while for other drugs, the hearing damage is permanent – but your healthcare provider will always weigh up the risks and benefits when prescribing ototoxic medication.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Problems with your jaw<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>If you have issues with your jaw or temporomandibular joint (TMJ), you may also find that you have issues with tinnitus. That’s because the TMJ shares some nerves and ligaments with your middle ear. You might find that you’re able to alter the intensity of your tinnitus by moving the position of your jaw, but your dentist should be able to treat your TMJ disorder and prevent your tinnitus from getting worse.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Ménière's disease<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>This is a rare condition that affects the inner ear, that can cause a feeling of pressure inside the ear and cause hearing loss, vertigo and tinnitus. People who suffer from this condition will experience some or all of these symptoms in a sudden attack that usually lasts two to three hours, although the effects can remain for a day or two after symptoms subside.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Problems with your blood pressure<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Certain conditions that affect your blood pressure, like high blood pressure, can change the way blood flows through your veins and arteries, causing it to move with more force. This can cause tinnitus, or if you already have tinnitus, it can make the ringing in your ears more noticeable.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Head or neck injuries<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Trauma to the head or neck can affect your inner ear, hearing nerves or the brain functions that are linked to hearing. If you have an accident or a blow to the head, you’ll usually only experience tinnitus in the ear that’s been affected.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Anemia<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Anemia, or iron deficiency, can lead to tinnitus. That’s because iron helps your blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs around your body, and when you’re lacking iron, your arteries may pump harder in order to deliver more blood. This results in pulsatile tinnitus, when you can hear your heartbeat in your ears.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Acoustic neuroma<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>This rare, non-cancerous tumor, can affect the hearing nerve of your inner ear, causing tinnitus.<\/p>",

This increases the risk of the earplugs becoming stuck in your ear canals, which is not only painful but potentially dangerous if you don’t remove them properly. <\/p><p>If they become lodged, you can seriously harm the delicate interior of your ear by trying to take them out on your own. So any blockage should be treated by an experienced healthcare professional. <\/p>",
