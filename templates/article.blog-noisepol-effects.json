And with good reason. Because in the modern world, it’s a very real problem, and something that many people are dealing with daily.<\/p><p>Air pollution. Water. Light. And not forgetting – the dreaded <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/blogs\/blog\/what-is-noise-pollution-definition-sources-prevention-amp-facts\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">noise pollution.  <\/span><\/a>Noise is all around us; it’s a guaranteed constant. We simply have to learn how to live our lives alongside it. And in many cases, how to allow it to enhance our lives for the better. <\/p><p>For example, think of natural noise such as birdsong, waves, or wind in the trees. It’s nature at its best. And something you may actively seek out to feel peaceful or calm. But on the flipside, you’re faced with noise such as construction works, traffic jams, and busy crowds. And that’s where noise pollution can come into play.<\/p><p>What is noise pollution? Simply put, noise pollution is the spread of unwanted sounds or disturbances in the environment. And depending on how and where we live our lives, the degree of noise pollution we’re exposed to varies. As human beings, we’re unique individuals who have varying tolerance levels when it comes to noise. And for those who find it difficult, noise pollution can play a huge part in the deterioration of their physical and mental health. <\/p><p>The glaring fact is: human activity is on the rise, and with it comes louder noise levels, resulting in more stress and ill-health. In fact, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eea.europa.eu\/publications\/environmental-noise-in-europe\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">2020 report by the EEA<\/span><\/a> (European Environment Agency), shows that environmental noise, in particular road traffic noise, remains a major (and growing) issue, affecting the health and well-being of millions of people in Europe.<\/p><p>Noise pollution is here and very real. But what impact is it really having on our mental and physical health? And crucially, what can we do to reduce it? Let’s take an in-depth look. <\/p>"
