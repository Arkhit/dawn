The resulting muscle spasm and tinnitus doesn’t necessarily come straight after the movement, and it can happen hours later.<\/p><p>In some cases, people with somatic tinnitus can even adjust the loudness or pitch of their tinnitus by manipulations of his or her jaw, eye movement, or by applying pressure to the head or neck.<\/p>",
