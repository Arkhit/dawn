It’s no big surprise, right? As a parent the noise levels you experience are constant – from wake-up through to bedtime (and sometimes throughout the night!).<\/p><p>And when sensory overload occurs, it’s easy to second-guess yourself. What’s wrong with me? Why am I not coping? Maybe I’m not cut out to be a parent after all…<\/p><p>Time to stop being hard on yourself. The world is becoming increasingly fast-paced, with added noise and pressures that are enough for any parent to experience sensory overload – let alone if you find yourself living with noise sensitivity. <\/p><p>In this blog post we’re going to take an up-close look at parent sensory overload. What it is, how to recognize it, and most importantly how to manage overstimulation. <\/p><p>Here we go.<\/p><p><\/p>",
