People who suffer from misophonia may be reluctant to put themselves into situations where they experience sounds they find irritating, which could lead to isolation.

The average onset is 12\/13\/14 years old. So I think there's also this fear that people won't be taken seriously when they report having it because there are a lot of other things going on around that age. And it tends to really peak in college and we see it more with women than men for some reason. But beyond that, there's still a lot that needs to be investigated about it.”<\/em><\/p><p>She goes on to explain that the lack of research into misophonia makes it difficult to fully understand what causes it:<\/p><p><em>“Misophonia is complicated because it's one of those things that's hard to pin down. Is it an ear-related thing? Is it a brain thing? Is it something that should be dealt with by a psychologist or an audiologist? And there's still a lot of research that needs to be done about it because we don't know enough about it yet to really be able to manage it well.”<\/em><\/p><p>She leans towards it being more of a psychological condition rather than an auditory one, however – and other studies back up that viewpoint, too. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5321671\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">One study<\/span><\/a>, which looked at a small sample of 20 people with misophonia and 22 people who don’t suffer from the condition, found that the brain plays a part in our reactions to certain sounds.<\/p><p>The researchers scanned the participants’ brains, and found that the parts of the brain that are responsible for long-term memories and fear are activated when hearing trigger sounds. This explains the strong emotional reactions people with misophonia have to certain sounds. It also suggests that the condition is rooted in our brain, with some sounds triggering a stronger reaction in this part of the brain for certain people, which results in feelings of anger, fear, anxiety or frustration.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/34273684\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Another study<\/span><\/a>, conducted in 2021, found that misophonia is linked to irregular brain connectivity and a larger amygdala. The amygdala is the part of our brain that helps to process emotions, emotional behavior and motivation – and the study found that the size of your amygdala may dictate how you respond to certain sounds.<\/p>",

Although listening to music on a daily basis might not seem like a problem, it’s something that most of us should be taking more seriously. Most people listen to music through their headphones or earbuds at 75 to 105 decibels. It takes just 8 hours of exposures to sound at 80 decibels without ear protection to cause damage.<\/p><p><strong>Kathleen Wallace<\/strong> explains:<\/p><p><em>“There is a lot of other noise that we are exposing ourselves to. It’s all self-inflicted. So if you are listening to music or podcasts or you’re watching TV, you have to think about what volume you’re listening at.”<\/em><\/p><p>She further explains:<\/p><p><em>“If you’re at a restaurant or some sort of situation where you don’t have your earplugs with you, I’d recommend downloading a sound level meter app where you can actually see how loud is this environment and you can make an educated decision about ‘do I want to stay in this environment?’, ‘how long can I stay in there and be safe?’ or ‘is there a quiet part I can move to, away from the kitchen or the bar?’.”<\/em><\/p>",
