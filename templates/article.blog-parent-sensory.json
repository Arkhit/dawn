It’s very focused on keeping you safe. So then your body releases stress hormones and the<br\/>blood flow into your brain moves to the primitive or lower centers. Sensory overload isn’t necessarily a new thing to parents. It can happen at any point during our lives.<\/p><p>But maybe before parenthood, sensory overload was easier to manage. You had more “you” time, more sleep, and more overall peace and quiet - all the things that work wonders in life to reset the tension.<\/p><p> It’s safe to say that parenthood doesn’t always bring the same sense of peace to the table. As a parent with sensory stimulation constantly overloading your nervous system, it’s common to go into a constant<br\/>state of fight-or-flight response mode. And being exposed to this all day, every day can make people feel desolate and angry, and eventually lead to feelings of depression and anxiety.<\/p><p><\/p>",

But when you start overpacking your schedule it can lead to stress. To try and minimize the stimulation, try and spread out activities as best you can, or eliminate them altogether if possible. It creates space for you to recharge, regulate your  feelings, and give your sensory system a break. You can only do so much.<\/li><li><strong>Accept multitasking isn’t always achievable <\/strong>You may pride yourself on your amazing multitasking abilities. And why shouldn’t you?  But the problem is that when we multitask our attention is divided, which means in turn that our sensory processing is divided too. This leaves an almost impossibly small window for anything else to get a look in (namely, your kids). So when you’re cooking dinner, answering an email, and having a conversation with your partner, remember to try and leave a bit of room for sensory interruptions or unexpected help requests. It will help limit your feelings of overwhelm from sensory overload.<\/li><li><strong>Schedule in Quiet Time <\/strong>Let everyone know that you are taking time for yourself. And then do it. Even if it’s just time out in your bedroom upstairs (complete with ‘do not disturb’ sign and all, if it works!). Maybe introduce quiet time for when you return home from an activity outdoors. That way, everyone will get into the routine and know where they stand. You know that you’ll get that all-important time to recharge, instead of getting to the point where overwhelm sets in and you snap and start to feel guilty. <\/li><li><strong>Let technology do its thing <\/strong>Most parents will agree: The iPad has saved them dealing with many meltdowns. It can be a very effective tool for distracting your children and giving you the breathing space that you need. That doesn’t mean to say that you have to put your kids in front of a screen for hours, but by allowing them iPad time, it means you get some much-needed time to recharge. Then you can come back more refreshed and ready to push through the sensory overload and overwhelm without the risk of snapping. The key is finding a balance and discovering ways that you can give yourself a break and recognising your own wellness as a priority, too.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/pages\/earplugs-for-parenting\/\"><strong>Use noise-canceling earplugs for parenting<\/strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong> <\/strong><\/span><\/a>When you consider that the sound of a baby crying can reach 120 dB (close to the noise intensity of a departing plane), it’s no surprise that sensory overwhelm is always looming. Noise-reducing earplugs can really help to deal with sensory overload as a parent. Earplugs such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/products\/engage\">Loop Engage<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/products\/engage-plus\">Loop Engage Plus<\/a>. These modern earplugs are especially designed to limit the volume of parenting, while making sure that you don’t miss a beat. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/products\/engage\">Loop Engage<\/a> are earplugs that take the edge off parenting life by reducing noise levels by up to 16 decibels.

They’re also ultra-comfortable and flexible, and fit into all types of ears. If you’re looking for a higher level of noise reduction, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/products\/engage-plus\">Loop Engage Plus<\/a> sound like the earplugs for you. They’re perfect for reducing the noise while still hearing everything crystal-clear, allowing you to focus on remaining present and calm. <\/li><li><strong>Practice self-care <\/strong>It’s not just a buzzword. It’s massively important to our wellbeing. As parents, we can almost find ourselves feeling guilty for taking the time. But it’s a major priority to ensure you care for yourself to pre-empt feelings of stress, overstimulation and burn out – you’ll feel more refreshed and less near breaking point.<\/li><li><strong>Put down the phone <\/strong>Tech can be a massive crutch when you’re parenting, especially for helping to combat feelings of isolation and helping you feel more connected to the outside world. The problem is, it can also be damaging and has links to sensory overload. When we are always on<br\/>our phones, our focus is intense so any distraction instantly becomes an interruption. You may not be aware of it, but it’s a leading cause of sensory overload in mothers and fathers everywhere. By limiting phone usage, you can also limit the amount of overstimulation you’re experiencing.<strong> <\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Say what you need <\/strong>Talk to your family about overstimulation. If your kids are the right age, it not only teaches them empathy, but is also a good lesson about why they should value their own wellbeing too.<\/li><\/ol>",
