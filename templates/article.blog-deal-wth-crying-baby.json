And cute. And they smell amazing. <\/p><p>But they can also cry. And cry. And cry and cry. And the really tough thing is when you’ve tried everything, and they still won’t stop.<\/p><p>You’ve rocked them for hours. You’ve driven them around the block more times than you can count. And of course, white noise has been the soundtrack to your life for days.<\/p><p>Add raging hormones and sleep deprivation into the mix and you have the perfect storm of emotion, exasperation, and exhaustion. Not to mention you can’t remember the last time you brushed your hair or took a shower.<\/p><p>It’s easy to start doubting your parenting abilities. But you’re not at fault; it’s just part of the wonder of parenting life.<\/p><p>In this blog post, we’re going to take a closer look at why babies cry, how you can deal with a crying baby, and how to get a handle on newborn frustration. Plus, how to look after yourself in the process.<\/p><p>Let’s get started.<\/p><p><\/p>",

Make sure to call your doctor if they do.<\/li><li>Rock your baby. The rhythmic motion will really help to comfort them. You could even try putting them in a swing or vibrating seat. <\/li><li>Sing or talk to your baby. We’re talking lullabies, cartoon theme tunes, or just simply talking to them in a hushed tone. You can even add a little gentle swaying dance into the mix.<\/li><li>Offer your baby a pacifier. They might not be hungry but the sucking motion will bring them comfort and they’ll fall off to sleep.<\/li><li>Take your baby for a walk in the stroller. The truth is that babies often sleep well on the move, as the bumpiness of the ground mimics that of you walking during pregnancy.<\/li><li>Hold your baby close. This can be as simple as cuddling them close to you or using a swaddler, and letting them feel you take slow, calm, and deep breaths.<\/li><li>Give your baby a warm bath. If they have any stomach pain the warm water will help, or they might just like the distraction.<\/li><li>Rub their back. They might have some trapped wind somewhere, so you can pat and rub their back gently to see if that helps ease the discomfort. Place them across your lap on their belly and give their back a rub, as some parents find this more effective for relieving discomfort from air bubbles.<\/li><li>Play music or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sleepfoundation.org\/noise-and-sleep\/white-noise\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">white noise<\/span><\/a>. Some babies respond to sound as well as movement. You could even try using the vacuum cleaner or the noise from the washing machine.<\/li><\/ul><p>If they’re still crying, then there may be an underlying cause that a visit to the doctor should be able to help with, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nhs.uk\/conditions\/reflux-in-babies\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">reflux<\/span><\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nhs.uk\/conditions\/colic\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">colic.<\/span><\/a><\/p>",

It is a treatment that concentrates on the here and now, rather than searching for a root cause in the past in the way that many other therapies do.<\/p><p><em><strong>Exposure therapy<\/strong><\/em><\/p><p>Exposure therapy, or systematic desensitization, is another type of psychotherapy that is regularly utilized when treating people with phonophobia.<\/p><p>It works by using guided and repeated exposure to the phobia in question in order to desensitize the patient. By being exposed to the source of the fear with no ill consequences, it is thought that exposure therapy can help the patient realize that their fear is unwarranted. <\/p><p>While this type of therapy can be upsetting, it’s also proved to be extremely effective with high success rates. <\/p><p>Don’t worry though – a therapist running an exposure therapy session will use a graded approach so that you’re not instantly overwhelmed. <\/p><p>So for example, if you are afraid of mice, the therapist may start a session just by showing you a drawing of a mouse. Then upping the exposure level as you become more and more desensitized to the stimuli. <\/p>",
