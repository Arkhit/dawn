If so, you might find that better time management is the answer when it comes to how to reduce stress at work. <\/p><p>Some ways to improve your time management include:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Understanding when you have the most energy.<\/strong> Can you get through lots of work in the morning, then you hit an afternoon slump? Or do you peak after lunch? Structuring your day around your energy levels can help you to work more efficiently, rather than fighting to focus when you’re not at your best.<\/li><li><strong>Make a to-do list.<\/strong> It might sound basic, but making a to-do list which is arranged in order of importance can really help you to get clear in your mind about what tasks are urgent, and which ones you can afford to let slide until tomorrow or the next day.<\/li><\/ul><p><strong>Set small targets.<\/strong> It’s easy to feel overwhelmed when you look at the big picture – and all you can see is an enormous project or a never-ending list of tasks. Breaking your work down into smaller tasks can help you to stay more motivated to achieve them, and less stressed, as it will seem far more manageable.<\/p>",

How we think about situations can affect the way we feel and behave, so CBT teaches us to interpret our thoughts in a different way for a different outcome.<\/p><p>At work, for example, you might have a big project due, which requires you to do a lot of work. You might think “This is too much work. I can’t do it all alone, and I have no support. I’m not capable of this.” These thoughts lead to you feeling anxious and depressed, so you might procrastinate, putting off working on the project until it’s really down to the wire.<\/p><p>CBT techniques can help you to reframe your thinking. Faced with the same situation, you could instead think something like “It’s a big project, but I’ve done big projects before. It’s really cool that my boss thinks I can do it all by myself – they obviously have a lot of faith in my abilities. I’m excited to be able to prove my worth.” That might make you feel excited, energized and eager to get started with the project.<\/p><p>Taking a step back and really scrutinizing how you feel about a work situation can help you turn it from something stressful into something positive.<\/p>",

If you have hearing loss, your brain may replace the absence of sound with a perceived sound, which manifests as a ringing in your ears.<\/p><p>Addressing this, with a hearing aid for instance, will ensure that your brain isn’t working as hard, which may reduce the effects of tinnitus. It also means that you’ll be better able to hear sounds that you weren’t able to hear before, which may counteract the tinnitus noises.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Tinnitus retraining therapy<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Tinnitus retraining therapy, also known as TRT, helps to retrain your brain. Through a combination of sound therapy and counseling, TRT supports you to tune out the ringing sounds and become less aware of it. This in turn, should help you to become less bothered by it over time.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Sound therapy<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7493236\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">2020 study<\/span><\/a> found that sound therapy can be effective in suppressing tinnitus. This involves exposure to background noises like white noise to mask the symptoms of tinnitus, or to distract you from it. There are several approaches to sound therapy, ranging from simple measures like opening a window to let noises from outside filter in, to using a white noise generator to produce a soothing sound that covers up the ringing in your ears.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Counseling<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>As tinnitus can be debilitating, it can be difficult to deal with it on your own. Talking therapy can help you to better understand your symptoms, and devise strategies to deal with it. <\/p><ul><li><strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy that aims to change a person’s thought patterns. In the case of tinnitus, it challenges one’s ways of thinking about their tinnitus, aiming to retrain their behavior. <\/p><p>Changing the way you think and feel about your tinnitus may not reduce the ringing you hear in your ears, but it can improve your outlook and reduce the impact your tinnitus has on your everyday life.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Self care<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>You may also wish to develop your own toolkit of coping strategies for your tinnitus, which you can pull out whenever you need help. That’s because tinnitus can become worse when you let your health and wellbeing slide. As <strong>Kathleen Wallace<\/strong> explains it:<\/p><p><em>“With tinnitus, it actually becomes more pronounced or more bothersome when people are stressed or when they are tired, or when they haven't eaten well. All of them can cause tinnitus spikes. So just like how noise can become more bothersome and can really result in stress and anxiety and all these things, it's the same thing with tinnitus.”<\/em><\/p><p>Some self care ideas for improving your health and staying on top of your tinnitus include:<\/p><ul><li>Relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga and deep breathing.<\/li><li>Improving your sleep – and your sleep routine. Things like sticking to a regular sleep schedule, avoiding using your phone before bed, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol can help you to get a better night’s sleep, and reduce your tinnitus symptoms.<\/li><li>Finding a hobby you enjoy: this can help to distract you from the irritating ringing you hear in your ears.<\/li><li>Talking and sharing your experience of tinnitus with others in the same position, through a support group.<\/li><\/ul>",
