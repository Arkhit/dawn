However, it was only after spending time in the United Kingdom that I found out that not many people know just how much more there is to Japan than Sushi. I want to change that. ​This is why I chose “Wagashi”. These authentic, traditional Japanese snacks and sweets can serve as a gateway to a different kind of Japanese experience.<br/><br/>　　With a variety of choices to fit and satisfy any taste, a well curated service could help elders, craftspeople and small businesses introduce their excellent products far beyond their normal customers. That’s part of the issue too. We think that these great local producers are at risk of disappearing and we want to act as a bridge to connect them to the world. ​For us, it’s important to enjoy the right things at the right pace.<br/><br/>We aim to harmonize this culture with our offering. We don’t want to feel pushy or in the way. We would like you to feel happy and confident that you will be getting a quality choice. Our service will deliver handpicked products, sourced directly by us from suppliers that we love.​ For now, we want to help you connect to Japan with “Wagashi” but we have over exciting services planned and our ultimate goal is help you discover Japan with us.<br/><br/>We want you to learn more about Japan, visit more easily, experience our culture and enjoy an authentic Japan even after returning home. We’ll be learning, improving and increasing in time and can’t wait to connect with customers around the world as we go.​​</p>",
