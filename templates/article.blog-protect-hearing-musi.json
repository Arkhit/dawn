So if you’re in a situation where you are regularly being exposed to excess decibel levels, then you should get your hearing regularly checked by a medical professional. <\/p><p>Hearing loss can often be hard to detect by yourself, and it can happen gradually as a result of continued exposure to loud noises. The gradual nature of hearing loss means it can really creep up on you. <\/p><p>Getting your hearing regularly tested can help you catch the signs of hearing loss early, and allow you to take the necessary steps to protect your hearing.<\/p><p><strong>2. Wear earmuffs<\/strong><\/p><p>Wearing earmuffs as a form of protection can go a long way toward protecting your hearing. They work by blocking out loud noises and dampening the intensity of sound as it reaches your ears. <\/p><p>This extra layer of protection helps you to protect the delicate structures of your ears and can reduce the risk of hearing loss. <\/p><p>Many musicians will wear earmuffs on stage. But as they do block out a lot of noise, you’ll regularly see people with one earmuff on and one earmuff off. While this means they can still hear the timing of the band around them, they are also only protecting one ear – making this an ineffective solution. <\/p><p><strong>3. Wear earplugs <\/strong><\/p><p>When it comes to protecting yourself in loud environments, earplugs are your best form of defense.<\/p><p>When it comes to hearing protection for music, most earplugs don’t eliminate noise entirely – nor would you want them to. <\/p><p>Loop earplugs simply reduce the decibel levels that your eardrums are exposed to – making them the perfect option for musicians who want to protect their eardrums while also still being able to hear the band around them, as well as the subtle intonations, nuances, and things that other earplugs force you to miss. <\/p><p>With Loop Experience earplugs, you’ll still be able to pick up on these fine details, allowing you to fully take your world of sound into your own hands. <\/p><p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/products\/experience\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Experience<\/span><\/a> earplugs can help you to reduce noise by up to 18 decibels, allowing you to fully immerse yourself into your music without having to sacrifice the health of your ears. <\/p><p>Our Experience earplugs have a built-in patented acoustic channel and mesh that filters sound equally across all frequencies. So you can fully experience your music whilst keeping the decibels to a safe level.<\/p><p>So whether it’s earplugs for singers, band members or even the backstage crew, Loops really are one of the best forms of protection.<\/p>",

It's like this Whee! noise in my head all the time. Should have worn earplugs, I guess.”<\/em><\/p><p>And here’s what three-time Rock & Roll Hall of Famer Eric Clapton has to say:<\/p><p><em>“I started using Fender Deluxe Reverb amps and 50-watt Marshalls around ’97, after I started having some problems with tinnitus. It was my own doing — being irresponsible and thinking I was invincible. . . .  Take care and wear plugs.”<\/em><\/p><p>Loop earplugs are the perfect music ear protectors.
