It also means that you’ll be better able to hear sounds that you weren’t able to hear before, which may counteract the tinnitus noises.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Tinnitus retraining therapy<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Tinnitus retraining therapy, also known as TRT, helps to retrain your brain. Through a combination of sound therapy and counseling, TRT supports you to tune out the ringing sounds and become less aware of it. This in turn, should help you to become less bothered by it over time.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Sound therapy<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7493236\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">2020 study<\/span><\/a> found that sound therapy can be effective in suppressing tinnitus. This involves exposure to background noises like white noise to mask the symptoms of tinnitus, or to distract you from it. There are several approaches to sound therapy, ranging from simple measures like opening a window to let noises from outside filter in, to using a white noise generator to produce a soothing sound that covers up the ringing in your ears.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Counseling<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>As tinnitus can be debilitating, it can be difficult to deal with it on your own. Talking therapy can help you to better understand your symptoms, and devise strategies to deal with it. <\/p><ul><li><strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy that aims to change a person’s thought patterns. In the case of tinnitus, it challenges one’s ways of thinking about their tinnitus, aiming to retrain their behavior. <\/p><p>Changing the way you think and feel about your tinnitus may not reduce the ringing you hear in your ears, but it can improve your outlook and reduce the impact your tinnitus has on your everyday life.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Self care<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>You may also wish to develop your own toolkit of coping strategies for your tinnitus, which you can pull out whenever you need help. That’s because tinnitus can become worse when you let your health and wellbeing slide. As <strong>Kathleen Wallace<\/strong> explains it:<\/p><p><em>“With tinnitus, it actually becomes more pronounced or more bothersome when people are stressed or when they are tired, or when they haven't eaten well. All of them can cause tinnitus spikes. So just like how noise can become more bothersome and can really result in stress and anxiety and all these things, it's the same thing with tinnitus.”<\/em><\/p><p>Some self care ideas for improving your health and staying on top of your tinnitus include:<\/p><ul><li>Relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga and deep breathing.<\/li><li>Improving your sleep – and your sleep routine. Things like sticking to a regular sleep schedule, avoiding using your phone before bed, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol can help you to get a better night’s sleep, and reduce your tinnitus symptoms.<\/li><li>Finding a hobby you enjoy: this can help to distract you from the irritating ringing you hear in your ears.<\/li><li>Talking and sharing your experience of tinnitus with others in the same position, through a support group.<\/li><\/ul>",
