But hearing loss can happen when the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/blogs\/blog\/hearing-damage-decibels-levels\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">decibels levels<\/span><\/a> are low – even as low as 85, especially when the exposure to this amplitude is constant.<\/p><p>Clubs tend to blast music louder than 115 decibels (a normal lawnmower is 100 decibels). People can experience significant damage listening to this level for eight hours. This may cause a ringing in your ears, even when you’re not standing next to the speaker. And not just for a day, if you’re not careful the ringing could be for life. <\/p><p>Listening to loud music on the regular can damage your hearing. Even if you’re not going to concerts every day, you could still be putting yourself at risk by blasting music through your earbuds.<\/p><p>We get it, though. It can be hard to quit listening to loud music. And it’s no wonder, given that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.audiologyresearch.org\/is-there-addiction-to-loud-music\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">one study found<\/span><\/a> that traits of addictive-like behavior to loud music were more commonly detected in members of nonprofessional rock and pop bands than in control subjects.<\/p><p>If you love listening to loud music through your earbuds, consider turning it down a notch or two. You can still get the feel-good factor while reducing the risk of hearing damage. If you don’t want to turn it down, then at least try to take breaks. It’s not just the loudness of sounds that can cause hearing damage, but also how long you’re exposed to the sound for.<\/p><p>And if you love attending festivals, concerts and other live music events? Well, it’s important to protect your ears so you can keep enjoying music for life. The best way to do that? Earplugs. When you wear earplugs that are specifically <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/pages\/best-earplugs-concerts\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">designed for concerts<\/span><\/a>, like the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/products\/experience-pro\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Loop Experience Plus<\/span><\/a>, you’ll get the full experience of loud and clear music. That’s because they’re designed to filter sound rather than muffle it, with up to 18 decibels of sound protection – plus an extra 5 db when you use the Loop Mute accessory.<\/p><p>That means you don’t need to miss out on the experiences you love for the sake of your hearing. Win-win all round!<\/p>",
