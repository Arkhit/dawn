If you need to completely block out sound, wax and foam ear plugs are often most effective. If you are a very light sleeper, these materials might be the best option. <\/p><p>The drawback of wax and foam ear plugs for sleeping, is that they can block out more noise than you really need – including preventing you from hearing important sounds that you would want to be woken up by. Wax and foam ear plugs also have an unfortunate tendency to fall out randomly and can be uncomfortable for side sleepers. They are also hardly a durable option - foam earplugs need to be replaced after each use, while wax rarely lasts more than a couple of weeks - making them more costly in the long run, and producing unnecessary waste. <\/p><p>What’s more, foam ear plugs have a very standardised size, which means they don’t fit comfortably in wider, narrower or bendy ear canals. Meanwhile wax ear plugs take time to warm up, and can be tricky to remove when you want to take them out. <\/p><p>Another alternative is active noise cancelling (ANC) ear plugs. These create a noise which cancels out other noises around you. While they can really reduce disruptive sounds, you will of course have to recharge them. <\/p><p>Silicone earplugs, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/products\/quiet\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Loop Quiet<\/span><\/a> for sleeping, offer you the best of both worlds. They reduce the noise levels you will hear by up to 27 decibels, but they still let through important sounds such as alarm clocks, smoke alarms or a baby crying. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/products\/quiet\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Loop Quiet<\/span><\/a> also sits flush in your ear which means they don't stick out. Made from 100% soft touch silicone, they move with you and stay put - you won't even notice them at night.
