That’s because you’re not moving around. You can bet that the flight attendants who are moving around constantly are feeling the heat!<\/p><p>It’s also down to the fact that there are different zones in planes, each with its own temperature control. So where you sit in the plane may have an impact on how hot or cold you feel.<\/p><p>That means it’s a good idea to wear lots of lightweight layers so you can add and remove them as you need. It’s tempting to save on suitcase space by dressing in your holiday clothes, especially if you’re only traveling with hand luggage. That’s fine but be sure to pack a cozy cardigan or hoody you can pull on if you’re feeling chilly, and you’re more likely to get a better sleep. <\/p><p>Not all airlines provide blankets, so it also means you’re prepared for anything – and if there is a blanket provided, it’s an added bonus.<\/p>",

Even when the lights are dimmed, the cabin will probably still be brighter than you’d ideally like for perfect sleeping conditions. The flight attendants need some light to carry out their tasks, while some passengers will turn on their personal lights so they can read their book, and others will be watching a movie on their individual screens.<\/p><p>Light at night can put our biological clocks out of sync, disrupting our sleep-wake patterns. But an eye mask can block out this artificial light, signaling to your body that it’s time to go to sleep. <\/p><p>Look for a mask that is comfortable to wear with straps that aren’t too tight. Most masks come with adjustable straps so you can get the perfect fit. The majority of masks are lightweight, but for an extra-relaxing sleep, look out for weighted masks. These add a little extra pressure on your eyes, which can help you to feel calmer and more grounded - even when you’re thousands of feet in the air.<\/p>",

It is a treatment that concentrates on the here and now, rather than searching for a root cause in the past in the way that many other therapies do.<\/p><p><em><strong>Exposure therapy<\/strong><\/em><\/p><p>Exposure therapy, or systematic desensitization, is another type of psychotherapy that is regularly utilized when treating people with phonophobia.<\/p><p>It works by using guided and repeated exposure to the phobia in question in order to desensitize the patient. By being exposed to the source of the fear with no ill consequences, it is thought that exposure therapy can help the patient realize that their fear is unwarranted. <\/p><p>While this type of therapy can be upsetting, it’s also proved to be extremely effective with high success rates. <\/p><p>Don’t worry though – a therapist running an exposure therapy session will use a graded approach so that you’re not instantly overwhelmed. <\/p><p>So for example, if you are afraid of mice, the therapist may start a session just by showing you a drawing of a mouse.

Premium economy passengers are also more likely to get a good night’s sleep, thanks to the extra leg room and more space to recline. But how to sleep on a plane in coach? And, more to the point, how to sleep sitting up on a plane?<\/p><p>Reclining your seat is a good bet for getting to sleep more comfortably – but good plane etiquette suggests that you check with the passenger behind you first. <\/p><p>It’s best to only recline your seat slightly as it puts less pressure on your hips than reclining all the way back. You can also pop a cushion at the base of your spine to support your lower back and pelvis.<\/p><p>If you’ve managed to snag a window seat, you can also rest your head against the window, ideally with a pillow in between you and the window. Window seats also have an added benefit: you won’t be woken up by other passengers in your row looking to get out into the aisle.<\/p><p><strong>How to sleep on a plane aisle seat<\/strong><\/p><p>Aisle seats can be beneficial if you have long legs and need space to stretch them out (just watch out for people walking by!). They also mean that you can get up and down as much as you like without bothering other passengers.<\/p><p>But they have one undeniable downside: you’re going to be asked to move by the other passengers in your row who need to get out to use the toilet, or want to walk up and down the aisle.<\/p><p>Recline your seat if you can, and make the most of the aisle space for your legs if you’re trying to sleep overnight. There’s unlikely to be any flight attendants passing by with carts during the night, and just the odd person walking around, so you should be safe to stretch your legs out.<\/p><p>There’s no getting around the fact that others in your row will want to get out at some point during the night. But hopefully, with sleep aids like the right earplugs and an eye mask, the distractions will be minimal and you’ll be able to get back to sleep faster.<\/p><p><strong>How to sleep on a plane middle seat<\/strong><\/p><p>In the middle seat, you don’t have the benefit of a window to rest your head against or an aisle to stretch your legs out. <\/p><p>So how do you get to sleep? Your best bet here is to use a neck pillow. This will stop you from falling asleep on your neighbor’s shoulder (awkward if you’re seated beside strangers!).<\/p><p>Also make sure to claim the armrests when you sit down. These will provide you with additional support when sleeping upright, helping to alleviate back pressure.<\/p><p>Alternatively, you might get a better sleep if you lean forward. Open your tray table and place a cushion on it. Then, armed with your eye mask and earplugs, pop your head down. <\/p><p>So, there you have it - how to sleep on a plane, or at least try to get a better night’s sleep! It’s important to be prepared, and that means taking your essentials with you including cozy clothes or a blanket, an eye mask and comfortable ear plugs. Whether you’re sitting in the window seat or stuck in the middle, you’ll have a much better chance of arriving at your destination refreshed when you follow these tips. Good luck - and enjoy your flight!<\/p>",
